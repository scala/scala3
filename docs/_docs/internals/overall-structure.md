title: "Dotty Overall Structure"
---

The compiler code is found in package [dotty.tools]. It spans the
following three sub-packages:

```
backend     Compiler backends (currently for JVM and JS)
   dotc     The main compiler
     io     Helper modules for file access and classpath handling.
```

The [dotc] package contains some main classes that can be run as separate
programs. The most important one is class [Main]. `Main` inherits from
[Driver] which contains the highest level functions for starting a compiler
and processing some sources. `Driver` in turn is based on two other high-level
classes, [Compiler] and [Run].

Package Structure
-----------------
Most functionality of `scalac` is implemented in subpackages of `dotc`. Here's a
list of sub-packages and their focus.

```

```

Contexts
--------
`scalac` has almost no global state (the only significant bit of global state is
the name table, which is used to hash strings into unique names). Instead, all
essential bits of information that can vary over a compiler run are collected
in a [Context]. Most methods in `scalac` take a `Context` value as an implicit
parameter.

Contexts give a convenient way to customize values in some part of the
call-graph. To run, e.g. some compiler function `f` at a given phase `phase`,
we invoke `f` with an explicit context parameter, like this

```scala
f(/*normal args*/)(using ctx.withPhase(phase))
```

This assumes that `f` is defined in the way most compiler functions are:

```scala
def f(/*normal parameters*/)(implicit ctx: Context) ...
```

Compiler code follows the convention that all implicit `Context` parameters are
named `ctx`.  This is important to avoid implicit ambiguities in the case where
nested methods contain each a Context parameters. The common name ensures then
that the implicit parameters properly shadow each other.

Sometimes we want to make sure that implicit contexts are not captured in
closures or other long-lived objects, be it because we want to enforce that
nested methods each get their own implicit context, or because we want to avoid
a space leak in the case where a closure can survive several compiler runs. A
typical case is a completer for a symbol representing an external class, which
produces the attributes of the symbol on demand, and which might never be
invoked. In that case we follow the convention that any context parameter is
explicit, not implicit, so we can track where it is used, and that it has a
name different from `ctx`. Commonly used is `ictx` for "initialization
context".

With these two conventions in place, it has turned out that implicit contexts
work amazingly well as a device for dependency injection and bulk
parameterization.  There is of course always the danger that an unexpected
implicit will be passed, but in practice this has not turned out to be much of
a problem.

Compiler Phases
---------------
Seen from a temporal perspective, the `scalac` compiler consists of a list of
phases. The current list of phases is specified in class [Compiler] as follows:

```scala
  def phases: List[List[Phase]] =

    List(new GenBCode) ::             // Generate JVM bytecode
    Nil
```

Note that phases are grouped, so the `phases` method is of type
`List[List[Phase]]`. The idea is that all phases in a group are *fused* into a
single tree traversal. That way, phases can be kept small (most phases perform
a single function) without requiring an excessive number of tree traversals
(which are costly, because they have generally bad cache locality).

Phases fall into four categories:

* Frontend phases: `Frontend`, `PostTyper` and `Pickler`. `FrontEnd` parses the
  source programs and generates untyped abstract syntax trees, which are then
  typechecked and transformed into typed abstract syntax trees.  `PostTyper`
  performs checks and cleanups that require a fully typed program. In
  particular, it

    - creates super accessors representing `super` calls in traits
    - creates implementations of synthetic (compiler-implemented) methods
    - avoids storing parameters passed unchanged from subclass to superclass in
      duplicate fields.

  Finally `Pickler` serializes the typed syntax trees produced by the frontend
  as TASTY data structures.

* High-level transformations: All phases from `FirstTransform` to `Erasure`.
  Most of these phases transform syntax trees, expanding high-level constructs
  to more primitive ones. The last phase in the group, `Erasure` translates all
  types into types supported directly by the JVM. To do this, it performs
  another type checking pass, but using the rules of the JVM's type system
  instead of Scala's.

* Low-level transformations: All phases from `ElimErasedValueType` to
  `CollectSuperCalls`. These further transform trees until they are essentially a
  structured version of Java bytecode.

* Code generators: These map the transformed trees to Java classfiles or
  .sjsir files.

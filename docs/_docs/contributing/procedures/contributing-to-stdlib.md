# Contributing to Scala Standard Library (SLC - Standard Library Changes)

The Scala standard library is hosted in the
[scala/scala3](https://github.com/scala/scala3) repository. Any changes that
influence the standard library API should follow this process. If the changes
are only internal, the process is the standard pull request one.

1. User creates a thread on
   [contributors forum](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/) (SLC: prefix or
   Standard Library Changes:) to explain the addition and why it might be
   needed. If possible together with a link to WiP PR.
2. After some time allowed for discussion, the addition will be scheduled for
   the next Scala Core meeting by the Scala Core Coordinator.
3. Scala Core Coordinator should schedule it within one month unless there are
   any special circumstances such as ongoing discussions and/or implementation
   work.
4. User can contact the Coordinator to discuss next steps at any point.
5. If there were no objections on the Core Meeting, normal PR review workflow
   might continue. There should be at least two approvals from the standard
   library working group, which can involve people outside the compiler team.

Currently, the working group is mainly comprised of compiler team members.
However, if anyone else is interested in participating, they can do so by
contacting the Coordinator. Inclusion in the working group must be approved by
the Scala Core team. Of course, anyone can participate in the PR review workflow
by commenting on the PR.

Current Coordinator can be found on the
[Scala Core Team page](https://www.scala-lang.org/scala-core/).

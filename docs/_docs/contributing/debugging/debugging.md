This section goes over the various ways to debug either the compiler or the code
that you're having issues with. This can be just inspecting the trees of your
code or stepping through the dotty codebase with a Debugger.

The following sections will help you with this:
- [Debugging with your IDE](./ide-debugging.md.md)
- [How to Inspect Values](./inspection.md)
- [Other Debugging Techniques](./other-debugging.md)

In this section, you will be able to answer questions such as:
- where does an error happen in a codebase?
- when during compilation was a particular tree introduced?
- where is a particular object created?
- where is a particular value assigned to a variable?

> You may be able to quickly find the source responsible for an issue by consulting [common issue locations](./areas.md)

## What phase generated a particular tree?

As described in the [compiler lifecycle](../architecture/lifecycle.md#phases-2),
each phase transforms the trees and types that represent your code in a certain
way.

To print the code as it is transformed through the compiler, use the compiler flag `-Xprint:all`.
After each phase group is completed, you will see the resulting trees representing the code.

> It is recommended to test `-Xprint:all` on a single, small file, otherwise a lot of unnecessary
> output will be generated.

### Trace a Tree Creation Site

When you see a problematic tree appear after a certain phase group, you know to isolate the rest of
your search to the code of that phase. For example if you found a problematic tree after phase
`posttyper`, the problem most likely appears in the code of [PostTyper]. We can trace the exact point
the tree was generated by looking for its unique ID, and then generating a stack trace at its creation:

1. Run the compiler with `-Xprint:posttyper` and `-Yshow-tree-ids` flags.
   This will only print the trees of the `posttyper` phase. This time you should see the tree
   in question be printed alongside its ID. You'll see something like `println#223("Hello World"#37)`.
2. Copy the ID of the desired tree.
3. Run the compiler with `-Ydebug-tree-with-id <tree-id>` flag. The compiler will print a stack trace
   pointing to the creation site of the tree with the provided ID.

If you are using a debugger, you can add a breakpoint after `if ownId == debugId then` in method `allocateId` of `Positioned.scala` (you will still need the flag), this will allow you to navigate the stack with more ease.
Do not use a conditional breakpoint, the time overhead is very significant for a method called as often as this one.

### Enhanced Tree Printing

As seen above `-Xprint:<phase>` can be enhanced with further configuration flags, found in
[ScalaSettings]. For example, you can additionally print the type of a tree with `-Xprint-types`.

## Increasing Logging Output
Once you have identified the phase that generated a certain tree, you can then increase
logging in that phase, to try and detect erroneous states:

- general logging within a phase can be enabled with the `-Ylog` compiler flag, such as
  - `-Ylog:<phase1>,<phase2>,...` for individual phases
  - `-Ylog:all` for all phases.
- Additionally, various parts of the compiler have specialised logging objects, defined in [Printers].
  Change any of the printers of interest from `noPrinter` to `default` and increase output specialised
  to that domain.

## Navigating to Where an Error is Generated

The compiler issues user facing errors for code that is not valid, such as the type mismatch
of assigning an `Int` to a `Boolean` value. Sometimes these errors do not match what is expected, which could be a bug.

To discover why such a *spurious* error is generated, you can trace the code that generated the error by
adding the `-Ydebug-error` compiler flag, e.g. `scala3/scalac -Ydebug-error Test.scala`.
This flag forces a stack trace to be printed each time an error happens, from the site where it occurred.

Analysing the trace will give you a clue about the objects involved in producing
the error. For example, you can add some debug statements before the error is
issued to discover the state of the compiler. [See some useful ways to debug
values.](../debugging/inspection.md)

### Where was a particular object created?

If you navigate to the site of the error, and discover a problematic object, you will want to know
why it exists in such a state, as it could be the cause of the error. You can discover the
creation site of that object to understand the logic that created it.

You can do this by injecting a *tracer* into the class of an instance in question.
A tracer is the following variable:

```scala
val tracer = Thread.currentThread.getStackTrace.mkString("\n")
```
When placed as a member definition at a class, it will contain a stack trace pointing at where exactly
its particular instance was created.

Once you've injected a tracer into a class, you can `println` that tracer from the error site or
other site you've found the object in question.

#### Procedure

1.  Determine the type of the object in question. You can use one of the following techniques to do so:
     - Use an IDE to get the type of an expression, or save the expression to a `val`
       and see its inferred type.
     - Use `println` to print the object or use `getClass` on that object.
2.  Locate the type definition for the type of that object.
3.  Add a field `val tracer = Thread.currentThread.getStackTrace.mkString("\n")` to that type definition.
4.  `println(x.tracer)` (where `x` is the name of the object in question) from the original site where you
    encountered the object. This will give you the stack trace pointing to the place where the
    constructor of that object was invoked.

### Where was a particular value assigned to a variable?

Say you have a certain [type](../architecture/types.md) assigned to a [Denotation] and you would like to know why it has that
specific type. The type of a denotation is defined by `var myInfo: Type`, and can be assigned multiple times.
In this case, knowing the creation site of that `Type`, as described above, is not useful; instead, you need to
know the *assignment* (not *creation*) site.

This is done similarly to how you trace the creation site. Conceptually, you need to create a proxy for that variable that will log every write operation to it. Practically, if you are trying to trace the assignments to a variable `myInfo` of type `Type`, first, rename it to `myInfo_debug`. Then, insert the following at the same level as that variable:

```scala
var tracer = "",
def myInfo: Type = myInfo_debug,
def myInfo_=(x: Type) = { tracer = Thread.currentThread.getStackTrace.mkString("\n"); myInfo_debug = x }
```

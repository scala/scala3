The [`enum` concept](./enums.md) is general enough to also support algebraic data
types (ADTs) and their generalized version (GADTs). Here is an example
how an `Option` type can be represented as an ADT:

```scala
enum Option[+T]:
  case Some(x: T)
  case None
```

This example introduces an `Option` enum with a covariant type
parameter `T` consisting of two cases, `Some` and `None`. `Some` is
parameterized with a value parameter `x`. It is a shorthand for writing a
case class that extends `Option`. Since `None` is not parameterized, it
is treated as a normal enum value.

The `extends` clauses that were omitted in the example above can also
be given explicitly:

```scala
enum Option[+T]:
  case Some(x: T) extends Option[T]
  case None       extends Option[Nothing]
```

Note that the parent type of the `None` value is inferred as
`Option[Nothing]`. Generally, all covariant type parameters of the enum
class are minimized in a compiler-generated `extends` clause whereas all
contravariant type parameters are maximized. If `Option` was non-variant,
you would need to give the extends clause of `None` explicitly.

As for normal enum values, the cases of an `enum` are all defined in
the `enum`s companion object. So it's `Option.Some` and `Option.None`
unless the definitions are "pulled out" with an import:

```scala
scala> Option.Some("hello")
val res1: t2.Option[String] = Some(hello)

scala> Option.None
val res2: t2.Option[Nothing] = None
```

Note that the type of the expressions above is always `Option`. Generally, the type of a enum case constructor application will be widened to the underlying enum type, unless a more specific type is expected. This is a subtle difference with respect to normal case classes. The classes making up the cases do exist, and can be unveiled, either by constructing them directly with a `new`, or by explicitly providing an expected type.

```scala
scala> new Option.Some(2)
val res3: Option.Some[Int] = Some(2)
scala> val x: Option.Some[Int] = Option.Some(3)
val res4: Option.Some[Int] = Some(3)
```

As all other enums, ADTs can define methods. For instance, here is `Option` again, with an
`isDefined` method and an `Option(...)` constructor in its companion object.

```scala
enum Option[+T]:
  case Some(x: T)
  case None

  def isDefined: Boolean = this match
    case None => false
    case _    => true

object Option:

  def apply[T >: Null](x: T): Option[T] =
    if x == null then None else Some(x)

end Option
```

Enumerations and ADTs have been presented as two different
concepts. But since they share the same syntactic construct, they can
be seen simply as two ends of a spectrum and it is perfectly possible
to construct hybrids. For instance, the code below gives an
implementation of `Color` either with three enum values or with a
parameterized case that takes an RGB value.

```scala
enum Color(val rgb: Int):
  case Red   extends Color(0xFF0000)
  case Green extends Color(0x00FF00)
  case Blue  extends Color(0x0000FF)
  case Mix(mix: Int) extends Color(mix)
```

### Parameter Variance of Enums

By default, parameterized cases of enums with type parameters will copy the type parameters of their parent, along
with any variance notations. As usual, it is important to use type parameters carefully when they are variant, as shown
below:

The following `View` enum has a contravariant type parameter `T` and a single case `Refl`, representing a function
mapping a type `T` to itself:

```scala
enum View[-T]:
  case Refl(f: T => T)
```

The definition of `Refl` is incorrect, as it uses contravariant type `T` in the covariant result position of a
function type, leading to the following error:

```scala
-- Error: View.scala:2:12 --------
2 |   case Refl(f: T => T)
  |             ^^^^^^^^^
  |contravariant type T occurs in covariant position in type T => T of value f
  |enum case Refl requires explicit declaration of type T to resolve this issue.
```

Because `Refl` does not declare explicit parameters, it looks to the compiler like the following:

```scala
enum View[-T]:
  case Refl[/*synthetic*/-T1](f: T1 => T1) extends View[T1]
```

The compiler has inferred for `Refl` the contravariant type parameter `T1`, following `T` in `View`.
We can now clearly see that `Refl` needs to declare its own non-variant type parameter to correctly type `f`,
and can remedy the error by the following change to `Refl`:

```diff
enum View[-T]:
-  case Refl(f: T => T)
+  case Refl[R](f: R => R) extends View[R]
```

Above, type `R` is chosen as the parameter for `Refl` to highlight that it has a different meaning to
type `T` in `View`, but any name will do.

After some further changes, a more complete implementation of `View` can be given as follows and be used
as the function type `T => U`:

```scala
enum View[-T, +U] extends (T => U):
  case Refl[R](f: R => R) extends View[R, R]

  final def apply(t: T): U = this match
    case refl: Refl[r] => refl.f(t)
```

### Syntax of Enums

Changes to the syntax fall in two categories: enum definitions and cases inside enums.
The changes are specified below as deltas with respect to the Scala syntax given [here](../syntax.md)

 1. Enum definitions are defined as follows:

    ```
    TmplDef   ::=  `enum' EnumDef
    EnumDef   ::=  id ClassConstr [`extends' [ConstrApps]] EnumBody
    EnumBody  ::=  [nl] ‘{’ [SelfType] EnumStat {semi EnumStat} ‘}’
    EnumStat  ::=  TemplateStat
                |  {Annotation [nl]} {Modifier} EnumCase
    ```

 2. Cases of enums are defined as follows:

    ```
    EnumCase  ::=  `case' (id ClassConstr [`extends' ConstrApps]] | ids)
    ```

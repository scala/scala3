A new trait [`Matchable`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Matchable.html) controls the ability to pattern match.

## The Problem

The Scala 3 standard library has a type [`IArray`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala.html#IArray-0) for immutable
arrays that is defined like this:

```scala
  opaque type IArray[+T] = Array[? <: T]
```

The `IArray` type offers extension methods for `length` and `apply`, but not for `update`; hence it seems values of type `IArray` cannot be updated.

However, there is a potential hole due to pattern matching. Consider:

```scala
val imm: IArray[Int] = ...
imm match
  case a: Array[Int] => a(0) = 1
```

The test will succeed at runtime since [`IArray`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala.html#IArray-0)s _are_ represented as
`Array`s at runtime. But if we allowed it, it would break the fundamental abstraction of immutable arrays.

__Aside:__ One could also achieve the same by casting:

```scala
imm.asInstanceOf[Array[Int]](0) = 1
```

But that is not as much of a problem since in Scala `asInstanceOf` is understood to be low-level and unsafe. By contrast, a pattern match that compiles without warning or error should not break abstractions.

Note also that the problem is not tied to [opaque types](opaques.md) as match selectors. The following slight variant with a value of parametric
type `T` as match selector leads to the same problem:

```scala
def f[T](x: T) = x match
  case a: Array[Int] => a(0) = 0
f(imm)
```

Finally, note that the problem is not linked to just [opaque types](opaques.md). No unbounded type parameter or abstract type should be decomposable with a pattern match.

## The Solution

There is a new type [`scala.Matchable`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Matchable.html) that controls pattern matching. When typing a pattern match of a constructor pattern `C(...)` or
a type pattern `_: C` it is required that the selector type conforms
to `Matchable`. If that's not the case a warning is issued. For instance when compiling the example at the start of this section we get:

```
> sc ../new/test.scala -source future
-- Warning: ../new/test.scala:4:12 ---------------------------------------------
4 |    case a: Array[Int] => a(0) = 0
  |            ^^^^^^^^^^
  |            pattern selector should be an instance of Matchable,
  |            but it has unmatchable type IArray[Int] instead
```

To allow migration from Scala 2 and cross-compiling
between Scala 2 and 3 the warning is turned on only for `-source future-migration` or higher.

[`Matchable`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Matchable.html) is a universal trait with `Any` as its parent class. It is extended by both [`AnyVal`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/AnyVal.html) and [`AnyRef`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/AnyRef.html). Since `Matchable` is a supertype of every concrete value or reference class it means that instances of such classes can be matched as before. However, match selectors of the following types will produce a warning:

- Type `Any`: if pattern matching is required one should use `Matchable` instead.
- Unbounded type parameters and abstract types: If pattern matching is required they should have an upper bound `Matchable`.
- Type parameters and abstract types that are only bounded by some
  universal trait: Again, `Matchable` should be added as a bound.

Here is the hierarchy of top-level classes and traits with their defined methods:

```scala
abstract class Any:
  def getClass
  def isInstanceOf
  def asInstanceOf
  def ==
  def !=
  def ##
  def equals
  def hashCode
  def toString

trait Matchable extends Any

class AnyVal extends Any, Matchable
class Object extends Any, Matchable
```

[`Matchable`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Matchable.html) is currently a marker trait without any methods. Over time
we might migrate methods `getClass` and `isInstanceOf` to it, since these are closely related to pattern-matching.

## `Matchable` and Universal Equality

Methods that pattern-match on selectors of type `Any` will need a cast once the
Matchable warning is turned on. The most common such method is the universal
`equals` method. It will have to be written as in the following example:

```scala
class C(val x: String):

  override def equals(that: Any): Boolean =
    that.asInstanceOf[Matchable] match
      case that: C => this.x == that.x
      case _ => false
```

The cast of `that` to [`Matchable`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Matchable.html) serves as an indication that universal equality
is unsafe in the presence of abstract types and opaque types since it cannot properly distinguish the meaning of a type from its representation. The cast
is guaranteed to succeed at run-time since `Any` and [`Matchable`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Matchable.html) both erase to
`Object`.

For instance, consider the definitions

```scala
opaque type Meter = Double
def Meter(x: Double): Meter = x

opaque type Second = Double
def Second(x: Double): Second = x
```

Here, universal `equals` will return true for

```scala
  Meter(10).equals(Second(10))
```

even though this is clearly false mathematically. With [multiversal equality](../contextual/multiversal-equality.md) one can mitigate that problem somewhat by turning

```scala
  import scala.language.strictEquality
  Meter(10) == Second(10)
```

into a type error.

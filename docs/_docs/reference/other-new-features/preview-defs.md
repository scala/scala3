New Scala language features or standard library APIs are initially introduced as experimental, but once they become fully implemented and accepted by the [SIP](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/) these can become a preview features.
Preview language features and APIs are guaranteed to be standardized in some next Scala minor release, but allow the compiler team to introduce small, possibly binary incompatible, changes based on the community feedback.
These can be used by early adopters who can accept the possibility of binary compatibility breakage. For instance, preview features could be used in some internal tool or application. On the other hand, preview features are discouraged in publicly available libraries.

Users can enable access to preview features and definitions by compiling with the `-preview` flag. The flag would enable all preview features and definitions. There is no scheme for enabling only a subset of preview features.

The biggest difference of preview features compared to experimental features is their non-viral behavior.
A definition compiled in preview mode (using the `-preview` flag) is not marked as a preview definition itself.
This behavior allows to use preview features transitively in other compilation units without explicitly enabled preview mode, as long as it does not directly reference APIs or features marked as preview.

The [`@preview`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/annotation/internal/preview.html) annotation is used to mark Scala 3 standard library APIs currently available under preview mode.
The rules for `@preview` are similar to [`@experimental`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/annotation/experimental.html) when it comes to accessing, subtyping, overriding or overloading definitions marked with this annotation - all of these can only be performed in compilation units that enable preview mode.

```scala
//> using options -preview
package scala.stdlib
import scala.annotation.internal.preview

@preview def previewFeature: Unit = ()

// Can be used in non-preview scope
def usePreviewFeature = previewFeature
```

```scala
def usePreviewFeatureTransitively = scala.stdlib.usePreviewFeature
def usePreviewFeatureDirectly = scala.stdlib.previewFeature // error - referring to preview definition outside preview scope
```

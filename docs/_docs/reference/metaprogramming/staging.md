title: "Run-Time Multi-Stage Programming"

The framework expresses at the same time compile-time metaprogramming and
multi-stage programming. We can think of compile-time metaprogramming as a
two stage compilation process: one that we write the code in top-level splices,
that will be used for code generation (macros) and one that will perform all
necessary evaluations at compile-time and an object program that we will run
as usual. What if we could synthesize code at run-time and offer one extra stage
to the programmer? Then we can have a value of type `Expr[T]` at run-time that we
can essentially treat as a typed-syntax tree that we can either _show_ as a
string (pretty-print) or compile and run. If the number of quotes exceeds the
number of splices by more than one (effectively handling at run-time values of type
`Expr[Expr[T]]`, `Expr[Expr[Expr[T]]]`, ...) then we talk about Multi-Stage
Programming.

The motivation behind this _paradigm_ is to let runtime information affect or
guide code-generation.

Intuition: The phase in which code is run is determined by the difference
between the number of splice scopes and quote scopes in which it is embedded.

 - If there are more splices than quotes, the code is run at compile-time i.e.
   as a macro. In the general case, this means running an interpreter that
   evaluates the code, which is represented as a typed abstract syntax tree. The
   interpreter can fall back to reflective calls when evaluating an application
   of a previously compiled method. If the splice excess is more than one, it
   would mean that a macroâ€™s implementation code (as opposed to the code it
   expands to) invokes other macros. If macros are realized by interpretation,
   this would lead to towers of interpreters, where the first interpreter would
   itself interpret an interpreter code that possibly interprets another
   interpreter and so on.

 - If the number of splices equals the number of quotes, the code is compiled
   and run as usual.

 - If the number of quotes exceeds the number of splices, the code is staged.
   That is, it produces a typed abstract syntax tree or type structure at
   run-time. A quote excess of more than one corresponds to multi-staged
   programming.

Providing an interpreter for the full language is quite difficult, and it is
even more difficult to make that interpreter run efficiently. So we currently
impose the following restrictions on the use of splices.

 1. A top-level splice must appear in an inline method (turning that method
    into a macro)

 2. The splice must call a previously compiled
    method passing quoted arguments, constant arguments or inline arguments.

 3. Splices inside splices (but no intervening quotes) are not allowed.


## API

The framework as discussed so far allows code to be staged, i.e. be prepared
to be executed at a later stage. To run that code, there is another method
in class `Expr` called `run`. Note that `$` and `run` both map from `Expr[T]`
to `T` but only `$` is subject to [Cross-Stage Safety](./macros.md#cross-stage-safety), whereas `run` is just a normal method.
`scala.quoted.staging.run` provides a `Quotes` that can be used to show the expression in its scope.
On the other hand `scala.quoted.staging.withQuotes` provides a `Quotes` without evaluating the expression.

```scala
package scala.quoted.staging

def run[T](expr: Quotes ?=> Expr[T])(using Compiler): T = ...

def withQuotes[T](thunk: Quotes ?=> T)(using Compiler): T = ...
```

## Create a new Scala 3 project with staging enabled

```shell
sbt new scala/scala3-staging.g8
```

From [`scala/scala3-staging.g8`](https://github.com/scala/scala3-staging.g8).

It will create a project with the necessary dependencies and some examples.

In case you prefer to create the project on your own, make sure to define the following dependency in your [`build.sbt` build definition](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Basic-Def.html)

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang" %% "scala3-staging" % scalaVersion.value
```

and in case you use `scalac`/`scala` directly, then use the `-with-compiler` flag for both:

```shell
scalac -with-compiler -d out Test.scala
scala -with-compiler -classpath out Test
```

## Example

Now take exactly the same example as in [Macros](./macros.md). Assume that we
do not want to pass a base double value statically but generate code at run-time and pass
the value, also at run-time. Note, how we make a future-stage function of type
`Expr[Double => Double]` in line 6 below. Using `staging.run { ... }` we can evaluate an
expression at runtime. Within the scope of `staging.run` we can also invoke `show` on an expression
to get a source-like representation of the expression.

```scala
import scala.quoted.*

// make available the necessary compiler for runtime code generation
given staging.Compiler = staging.Compiler.make(getClass.getClassLoader)

val power3: Double => Double = staging.run {
  val stagedPower3: Expr[Double => Double] =
    '{ (x: Double) => ${ unrolledPowerCode('x, 3) } }
  println(stagedPower3.show) // Prints "((x: scala.Double) => x.*(x.*(x)))"
  stagedPower3
}

power3.apply(2.0) // Returns 8.0
```

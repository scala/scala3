title: "Explicit Nulls"

---

Explicit nulls is an opt-in feature that modifies the Scala type system, which makes reference types
(anything that extends [`AnyRef`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/AnyRef.html)) _non-nullable_.

This means the following code will no longer typecheck:

```scala
val x: String = null // error: found `Null`, but required `String`
```

Instead, to mark a type as nullable we use a [union type](../new-types/union-types.md)

```scala
val x: String | Null = null // ok
```

A nullable type could have null value during runtime; hence, it is not safe to select a member without checking its nullity.

```scala
x.trim // error: trim is not member of String | Null
```

Explicit nulls are enabled via a `-Yexplicit-nulls` flag.

Read on for details.

## New Type Hierarchy

Originally, `Null` is a subtype of all reference types.

!["Original Type Hierarchy"](images/explicit-nulls/scalaHierarchyWithMatchable.png)

When explicit nulls is enabled, the type hierarchy changes so that `Null` is only
a subtype of `Any` and `Matchable`, as opposed to every reference type,
which means `null` is no longer a value of `AnyRef` and its subtypes.

This is the new type hierarchy:

!["Type Hierarchy for Explicit Nulls"](images/explicit-nulls/scalaHierarchyWithMatchableAndSafeNull.png)

After erasure, `Null` remains a subtype of all reference types (as forced by the JVM).

## Working with `Null`

To make working with nullable values easier, we propose adding a few utilities to the standard library.
So far, we have found the following useful:

- An extension method `.nn` to "cast away" nullability

  ```scala
   extension [T](x: T | Null)
     inline def nn: T =
       assert(x != null)
       x.asInstanceOf[T]
  ```

  This means that given `x: String | Null`, `x.nn` has type `String`, so we can call all the
  usual methods on it. Of course, `x.nn` will throw a NPE if `x` is `null`.

  Don't use `.nn` on mutable variables directly, because it may introduce an unknown type into the type of the variable.

- An [`unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html) language feature.

  When imported, `T | Null` can be used as `T`, similar to regular Scala (without explicit nulls).

  See [UnsafeNulls](#unsafenulls) section for more details.

## Unsoundness

The new type system is unsound with respect to `null`. This means there are still instances where an expression has a non-nullable type like `String`, but its value is actually `null`.

The unsoundness happens because uninitialized fields in a class start out as `null`:

```scala
class C:
  val f: String = foo(f)
  def foo(f2: String): String = f2

val c = new C()
// c.f == "field is null"
```

The unsoundness above can be caught by the compiler with the option `-Wsafe-init`.
More details can be found in [safe initialization](../other-new-features/safe-initialization.md).

## Equality

We still allow the double-equal (`==` and `!=`), reference (`eq` and `ne`) comparison,
and pattern matching between `Null` and reference types.
Even if a type is non-nullable, we still need to consider the possibility of `null` value
caused by the Java methods or uninitialized values.

## Java Interoperability and Flexible Types

When dealing with reference types from Java, it's essential to address the implicit nullability of these types.
The most accurate way to represent them in Scala is to use nullable types, though working with lots of nullable types
directly can be annoying.
To streamline interactions with Java libraries, we introduce the concept of flexible types.

The flexible type, denoted by `T?`, functions as an abstract type with unique bounds: `T | Null ... T`,
ensuring that `T | Null <: T? <: T`.
The subtyping rule treats a reference type coming from Java as either nullable or non-nullable depending on the context.
This concept draws inspiration from Kotlin's
[platform types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types).
By relaxing null checks for such types, Scala aligns its safety guarantees with those of Java.
Notably, flexible types are non-denotable, meaning users cannot explicitly write them in the code;
only the compiler can construct or infer these types.

Consequently, a value with a flexible type can serve as both a nullable and non-nullable value.
Additionally, both nullable and non-nullable values can be passed as parameters with flexible types during function calls.
Invoking the member functions of a flexible type is allowed, but it can trigger a `NullPointerException`
if the value is indeed `null` during runtime.

```scala
// Considering class J is from Java
class J {
  // Translates to def f(s: String?): Unit
  public void f(String s) {
  }

  // Translates to def g(): String?
  public String g() {
    return "";
  }
}

// Use J in Scala
def useJ(j: J) =
  val x1: String = ""
  val x2: String | Null = null
  j.f(x1) // Passing String to String?
  j.f(x2) // Passing String | Null to String?
  j.f(null) // Passing Null to String?

  // Assign String? to String
  val y1: String = j.g()
  // Assign String? to String | Null
  val y2: String | Null = j.g()

  // Calling member functions on flexible types
  j.g().trim().length()
```

Upon loading a Java class, whether from source or bytecode, the Scala compiler dynamically adjusts the type of its members to reflect nullability.
This adjustment involves adding flexible types to the reference types of fields, as well as the argument types and return types of methods

We illustrate the rules with following examples:

- The first two rules are easy: we nullify reference types but not value types.

  ```java
  class C {
    String s;
    int x;
  }
  ```

  ==>

  ```scala
  class C:
    val s: String?
    val x: Int
  ```

- We nullify type parameters because in Java a type parameter is always nullable, so the following code compiles.

  ```java
  class C<T> { T foo() { return null; } }
  ```

  ==>

  ```scala
  class C[T] { def foo(): T? }
  ```

- We can reduce the number of redundant nullable types we need to add. Consider

  ```java
  class Box<T> { T get(); }
  class BoxFactory<T> { Box<T> makeBox(); }
  ```

  ==>

  ```scala
  class Box[T] { def get(): T? }
  class BoxFactory[T] { def makeBox(): Box[T]? }
  ```

  Suppose we have a `BoxFactory[String]`. Notice that calling `makeBox()` on it returns a
  `Box[T]?`, not a `Box[T?]?`. This seems at first
  glance unsound ("What if the box itself has `null` inside?"), but is sound because calling
  `get()` on a `Box[String]` returns a `String?`.

  Notice that we need to patch _all_ Java-defined classes that transitively appear in the
  argument or return type of a field or method accessible from the Scala code being compiled.
  Absent crazy reflection magic, we think that all such Java classes _must_ be visible to
  the Typer in the first place, so they will be patched.

- We will patch the type arguments if the generic class is defined in Scala.

  ```java
  class BoxFactory<T> {
    Box<T> makeBox(); // Box is Scala-defined
    List<Box<List<T>>> makeCrazyBoxes(); // List is Java-defined
  }
  ```

  ==>

  ```scala
  class BoxFactory[T]:
    def makeBox(): Box[T?]?
    def makeCrazyBoxes(): java.util.List[Box[java.util.List[T]?]]?
  ```

  In this case, since `Box` is Scala-defined, we will get `Box[T?]?`.
  This is needed because our nullability function is only applied (modularly) to the Java
  classes, but not to the Scala ones, so we need a way to tell `Box` that it contains a
  nullable value.

  The `List` is Java-defined, so we don't patch its type argument. But we
  still need to nullify its inside.

- We don't nullify _simple_ literal constant (`final`) fields, since they are known to be non-null

  ```java
  class Constants {
    final String NAME = "name";
    final int AGE = 0;
    final char CHAR = 'a';

    final String NAME_GENERATED = getNewName();
  }
  ```

  ==>

  ```scala
  class Constants:
    val NAME: String("name") = "name"
    val AGE: Int(0) = 0
    val CHAR: Char('a') = 'a'

    val NAME_GENERATED: String | Null = getNewName()
  ```

- We don't patch a field nor to a return type of a method which is annotated with a
  `NotNull` annotation.

  ```java
  class C {
    @NotNull String name;
    @NotNull List<String> getNames(String prefix); // List is Java-defined
    @NotNull Box<String> getBoxedName(); // Box is Scala-defined
  }
  ```

  ==>

  ```scala
  class C:
    val name: String
    def getNames(prefix: String?): java.util.List[String] // we still need to nullify the paramter types
    def getBoxedName(): Box[String?] // we don't append `Null` to the outmost level, but we still need to nullify inside
  ```

  The annotation must be from the list below to be recognized as `NotNull` by the compiler.
  Check `Definitions.scala` for an updated list.

  ```scala
  // A list of annotations that are commonly used to indicate
  // that a field/method argument or return type is not null.
  // These annotations are used by the nullification logic in
  // JavaNullInterop to improve the precision of type nullification.
  // We don't require that any of these annotations be present
  // in the class path, but we want to create Symbols for the
  // ones that are present, so they can be checked during nullification.
  @tu lazy val NotNullAnnots: List[ClassSymbol] = ctx.getClassesIfDefined(
    "javax.annotation.Nonnull" ::
    "edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.NonNull" ::
    "androidx.annotation.NonNull" ::
    "android.support.annotation.NonNull" ::
    "android.annotation.NonNull" ::
    "com.android.annotations.NonNull" ::
    "org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull" ::
    "org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual.NonNull" ::
    "org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.compatqual.NonNullDecl" ::
    "org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull" ::
    "lombok.NonNull" ::
    "io.reactivex.annotations.NonNull" :: Nil map PreNamedString)
  ```

Flexible types can be disabled by using `-Yno-flexible-types` flag.
The ordinary union type `| Null` will be used instead.

### Override check

When we check overriding between Scala classes and Java classes, the rules are relaxed for [`Null`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/Null.html) type with this feature, in order to help users to working with Java libraries.

Suppose we have Java method `String f(String x)`, we can override this method in Scala in any of the following forms:

```scala
def f(x: String | Null): String | Null

def f(x: String): String | Null

def f(x: String | Null): String

def f(x: String): String
```

Note that some of the definitions could cause unsoundness. For example, the return type is not nullable, but a `null` value is actually returned.

## Flow Typing

We added a simple form of flow-sensitive type inference. The idea is that if `p` is a
stable path or a trackable variable, then we can know that `p` is non-null if it's compared
with `null`. This information can then be propagated to the `then` and `else` branches
of an if-statement (among other places).

Example:

```scala
val s: String | Null = ???
if s != null then
  // s: String

// s: String | Null

assert(s != null)
// s: String
```

A similar inference can be made for the `else` case if the test is `p == null`

```scala
if s == null then
  // s: String | Null
else
  // s: String
```

`==` and `!=` is considered a comparison for the purposes of the flow inference.

### Logical Operators

We also support logical operators (`&&`, `||`, and `!`):

```scala
val s: String | Null = ???
val s2: String | Null = ???
if s != null && s2 != null then
  // s: String
  // s2: String

if s == null || s2 == null then
  // s: String | Null
  // s2: String | Null
else
  // s: String
  // s2: String
```

### Inside Conditions

We also support type specialization _within_ the condition, taking into account that `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting:

```scala
val s: String | Null = ???

if s != null && s.length > 0 then // s: String in `s.length > 0`
  // s: String

if s == null || s.length > 0 then // s: String in `s.length > 0`
  // s: String | Null
else
  // s: String
```

### Match Case

The non-null cases can be detected in match statements.

```scala
val s: String | Null = ???

s match
  case _: String => // s: String
  case _ =>
```

### Mutable Variable

We are able to detect the nullability of some local mutable variables. A simple example is:

```scala
class C(val x: Int, val next: C | Null)

var xs: C | Null = C(1, C(2, null))
// xs is trackable, since all assignments are in the same method
while xs != null do
  // xs: C
  val xsx: Int = xs.x
  val xscpy: C = xs
  xs = xscpy // since xscpy is non-null, xs still has type C after this line
  // xs: C
  xs = xs.next // after this assignment, xs can be null again
  // xs: C | Null
```

When dealing with local mutable variables, there are two questions:

1. Whether to track a local mutable variable during flow typing.
   We track a local mutable variable if the variable is not assigned in a closure.
   For example, in the following code `x` is assigned to by the closure `y`, so we do not
   do flow typing on `x`.

   ```scala
   var x: String | Null = ???
   def y =
     x = null

   if x != null then
      // y can be called here, which would break the fact
      val a: String = x // error: x is captured and mutated by the closure, not trackable
   ```

2. Whether to generate and use flow typing on a specific _use_ of a local mutable variable.
   We only want to do flow typing on a use that belongs to the same method as the definition
   of the local variable.
   For example, in the following code, even `x` is not assigned to by a closure, we can only
   use flow typing in one of the occurrences (because the other occurrence happens within a
   nested closure).

   ```scala
   var x: String | Null = ???
   def y =
     if x != null then
       // not safe to use the fact (x != null) here
       // since y can be executed at the same time as the outer block
       val _: String = x
   if x != null then
     val a: String = x // ok to use the fact here
     x = null
   ```

See [more examples](https://github.com/scala/scala3/blob/main/tests/explicit-nulls/neg/flow-varref-in-closure.scala).

Currently, we are unable to track paths with a mutable variable prefix.
For example, `x.a` if `x` is mutable.

### Unsupported Idioms

We don't support:

- flow facts not related to nullability (`if x == 0 then { // x: 0.type not inferred }`)
- tracking aliasing between non-nullable paths

  ```scala
  val s: String | Null = ???
  val s2: String | Null = ???
  if s != null && s == s2 then
    // s:  String inferred
    // s2: String not inferred
  ```

### UnsafeNulls

It is difficult to work with many nullable values, we introduce a language feature [`unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html).
Inside this "unsafe" scope, all `T | Null` values can be used as `T`.

Users can import [`scala.language.unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html) to create such scopes, or use `-language:unsafeNulls` to enable this feature globally (for migration purpose only).

Assume `T` is a reference type (a subtype of `AnyRef`), the following unsafe operation rules are
applied in this unsafe-nulls scope:

1. the members of `T` can be found on `T | Null`

2. a value with type `T` can be compared with `T | Null` and `Null`

3. suppose `T1` is not a subtype of `T2` using explicit-nulls subtyping (where `Null` is a direct
subtype of Any), extension methods and implicit conversions designed for `T2` can be used for
`T1` if `T1` is a subtype of `T2` using regular subtyping rules (where `Null` is a subtype of every
reference type)

4. suppose `T1` is not a subtype of `T2` using explicit-nulls subtyping, a value with type `T1`
can be used as `T2` if `T1` is a subtype of `T2` using regular subtyping rules

Addtionally, `null` can be used as `AnyRef` (`Object`), which means you can select `.eq` or `.toString` on it.

The program in [`unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html) will have a **similar** semantic as regular Scala, but not **equivalent**.

For example, the following code cannot be compiled even using unsafe nulls. Because of the
Java interoperation, the type of the get method becomes `T | Null`.

```scala
def head[T](xs: java.util.List[T]): T = xs.get(0) // error
```

Since the compiler doesn’t know whether `T` is a reference type, it is unable to cast `T | Null`
to `T`. A `.nn` need to be inserted after `xs.get(0)` by user manually to fix the error, which
strips the `Null` from its type.

The intention of this [`unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html) is to give users a better migration path for explicit nulls.
Projects for Scala 2 or regular Scala 3 can try this by adding `-Yexplicit-nulls -language:unsafeNulls`
to the compile options. A small number of manual modifications are expected. To migrate to the full
explicit nulls feature in the future, `-language:unsafeNulls` can be dropped and add
`import scala.language.unsafeNulls` only when needed.

```scala
def f(x: String): String = ???
def nullOf[T >: Null]: T = null

import scala.language.unsafeNulls

val s: String | Null = ???
val a: String = s // unsafely convert String | Null to String

val b1 = s.trim // call .trim on String | Null unsafely
val b2 = b1.length

f(s).trim // pass String | Null as an argument of type String unsafely

val c: String = null // Null to String

val d1: Array[String] = ???
val d2: Array[String | Null] = d1 // unsafely convert Array[String] to Array[String | Null]
val d3: Array[String] = Array(null) // unsafe

class C[T >: Null <: String] // define a type bound with unsafe conflict bound

val n = nullOf[String] // apply a type bound unsafely
```

Without the [`unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html), all these unsafe operations will not be type-checked.

[`unsafeNulls`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$unsafeNulls$.html) also works for extension methods and implicit search.

```scala
import scala.language.unsafeNulls

val x = "hello, world!".split(" ").map(_.length)

given Conversion[String, Array[String]] = _ => ???

val y: String | Null = ???
val z: Array[String | Null] = y
```

## Binary Compatibility

Our strategy for binary compatibility with Scala binaries that predate explicit nulls
and new libraries compiled without `-Yexplicit-nulls` is to leave the types unchanged
and be compatible but unsound.

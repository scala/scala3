Compiler plugins are supported in Scala 3 since Dotty 0.9. There are two notable changes
compared to Scala 2:

- No support for analyzer plugins
- Added support for research plugins

[Analyzer plugins][1] run in Scala 2 during type checking and may influence
normal type checking. This is a very powerful feature but for production usages,
a predictable and consistent type checker is more important.

For experimentation and research, Scala 3 introduces _research plugin_. Research plugins
are more powerful than Scala 2 analyzer plugins as they let plugin authors customize
the whole compiler pipeline. One can easily replace the standard typer by a custom one or
create a parser for a domain-specific language. However, research plugins are only
enabled with the `-experimental` compiler flag or in nightly/snapshot releases of Scala 3.

Common plugins that add new phases to the compiler pipeline are called
_standard plugins_ in Scala 3. In terms of features, they are similar to
`scalac` plugins, despite minor changes in the API.

## Using Compiler Plugins

In Scala 3, both standard and research plugins can be used with `scalac` by adding the `-Xplugin:` option:

```shell
scalac -Xplugin:pluginA.jar -Xplugin:pluginB.jar Test.scala
```

The compiler will examine the jar provided, and look for a property file named
`plugin.properties` in the root directory of the jar. The property file specifies
the fully qualified plugin class name. The format of a property file is as follows:

```properties
pluginClass=dividezero.DivideZero
```

This is different from Scala 2 plugins that require a `scalac-plugin.xml` file.

Starting from 1.1.5, `sbt` also supports Scala 3 compiler plugins. Please refer to the
[`sbt` documentation][2] for more information.

## Writing a Standard Compiler Plugin

Here is the source code for a simple compiler plugin that reports integer divisions by
zero as errors.

```scala
package dividezero

import dotty.tools.dotc.ast.Trees.*
import dotty.tools.dotc.ast.tpd
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.Constants.Constant
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.Contexts.Context
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.Decorators.*
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.StdNames.*
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.Symbols.*
import dotty.tools.dotc.plugins.{PluginPhase, StandardPlugin}
import dotty.tools.dotc.transform.{Pickler, Staging}

class DivideZero extends StandardPlugin:
  val name: String = "divideZero"
  override val description: String = "divide zero check"

  override def initialize(options: List[String])(using Context): List[PluginPhase] =
    (new DivideZeroPhase) :: Nil

class DivideZeroPhase extends PluginPhase:
  import tpd.*

  val phaseName = "divideZero"

  override val runsAfter = Set(Pickler.name)
  override val runsBefore = Set(Staging.name)

  override def transformApply(tree: Apply)(implicit ctx: Context): Tree =
    tree match
      case Apply(Select(rcvr, nme.DIV), List(Literal(Constant(0))))
      if rcvr.tpe <:< defn.IntType =>
        report.error("dividing by zero", tree.pos)
      case _ =>
        ()
    tree
end DivideZeroPhase
```

The plugin main class (`DivideZero`) must extend the trait `StandardPlugin`
and implement the method `initialize` that takes the plugin's options as argument
and returns a list of `PluginPhase`s to be inserted into the compilation pipeline.

Our plugin adds one compiler phase to the pipeline. A compiler phase must extend
the `PluginPhase` trait. In order to specify when the phase is executed, we also
need to specify a `runsBefore` and `runsAfter` constraints that are list of phase
names.

We can now transform trees by overriding methods like `transformXXX`.

## Writing a Research Compiler Plugin

Here is a template for research plugins.

```scala
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.Contexts.Context
import dotty.tools.dotc.core.Phases.Phase
import dotty.tools.dotc.plugins.ResearchPlugin

class DummyResearchPlugin extends ResearchPlugin:
  val name: String = "dummy"
  override val description: String = "dummy research plugin"

  def init(options: List[String], phases: List[List[Phase]])(implicit ctx: Context): List[List[Phase]] =
    phases
end DummyResearchPlugin
```

A research plugin must extend the trait `ResearchPlugin`  and implement the
method `init` that takes the plugin's options as argument as well as the compiler
pipeline in the form of a list of compiler phases. The method can replace, remove
or add any phases to the pipeline and return the updated pipeline.

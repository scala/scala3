# E103: Illegal Start of Statement

This error is emitted when the compiler encounters a token or expression that cannot legally begin a statement in that context.

A statement is an import, export, a definition, or an expression. Some statements are only allowed in certain contexts. This error often occurs when the parser encounters something that looks like it could start a definition but is actually invalid syntax at the top level.

One of the most common cases of this error is using an expression (e.g., method invocation) outside of a class or top-level member definition.

## Example

```scala sc:nocompile custom-sc:fail
package example 

def fa(f: String ?=> Unit): Unit = ???
fa(42) 
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E103] Syntax Error: example.scala:4:0 --------------------------------------
4 |fa(42)
  |^^
  |Illegal start of toplevel definition

### Solution

Wrap the expression in a method definition:

```scala sc:nocompile custom-sc:compile
// Wrap the call in a method definition
package example

def fa(f: String ?=> Unit): Unit = ???
def test: Unit = fa(())
```

# E046: Cyclic Reference Involving

This error is emitted when there is a cyclic reference in type definitions that makes it impossible for the compiler to determine the types involved.

A cyclic reference occurs when a type parameter references itself in its own bounds, creating a cycle that the compiler cannot resolve.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain-cyclic
trait A:
  type F[X <: F, Y]
```

### Error

When compiled with `-explain-cyclic`, the compiler shows the dependency chain:

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E046] Cyclic Error: example.scala:2:14 -------------------------------------
2 |  type F[X <: F, Y]
  |              ^
  |Cyclic reference involving type F
  |
  |The error occurred while trying to compute the signature of type F
  |  which required to compute the signature of type X
  |  which required to compute the signature of type F
  |
  | Run with both -explain-cyclic and -Ydebug-cyclic to see full stack trace.
  |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Explanation (enabled by `-explain`)
  |- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  | type F is declared as part of a cycle which makes it impossible for the
  | compiler to decide upon F's type.
  | To avoid this error, try giving F an explicit type.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Use a different bound that doesn't reference itself
trait A:
  type F[X, Y]
```

```scala sc:compile
// Or use an upper bound that is well-defined
trait A:
  type F[X <: Any, Y]
```

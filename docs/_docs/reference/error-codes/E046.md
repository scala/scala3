# E046: Cyclic Reference Involving

This error is emitted when there is a cyclic reference in type definitions that makes it impossible for the compiler to determine the types involved.

A cyclic reference occurs when the definition of a type or value depends on itself, either directly or through a chain of other definitions. To resolve this, try giving the involved definitions explicit types.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
class A extends B
class B extends A
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E046] Cyclic Error: example.scala:1:6 
1 |class A extends B
  |      ^
  |      Cyclic reference involving class A
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Break the cycle by using a common parent
trait Common

class A extends Common
class B extends Common
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use composition instead of inheritance
class A:
  var b: B = null

class B:
  var a: A = null
```

# E207: Illegal Unroll Placement

This error occurs when the `@unroll` annotation is used in an invalid location. The `@unroll` annotation is an experimental feature that can only be applied to method parameters with default values.

The `@unroll` annotation is used to generate multiple overloaded versions of a method to maintain binary compatibility when adding new parameters with default values.

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-experimental
import scala.annotation.unroll

@unroll
class UnrollClass
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E207] Declaration Error: example.scala:4:6 ---------------------------------
4 |class UnrollClass
  |      ^
  |      @unroll is only allowed on a method parameter
```

### Solution

Use the `@unroll` annotation only on method or constructor parameters that have default values:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
import scala.annotation.unroll
import scala.annotation.experimental

@experimental
final class Unrolled(s: String, n: Int = 1, @unroll b: Boolean = true):
  def foo = s + n + b
```

Note that `@unroll` has additional restrictions:
- The method must be effectively final (cannot be overridden)
- The method cannot be local
- For case classes, the annotation should be on the class constructor, not on generated methods

This is an experimental feature and requires the `-experimental` compiler flag.

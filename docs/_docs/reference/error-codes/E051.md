# E051: Ambiguous Overload

This error is emitted when there are multiple overloaded methods that match the given arguments and the compiler cannot determine which one to call.

There are multiple methods that could be referenced because the compiler knows too little about the expected type. You may specify the expected type by:
- Assigning the result to a value with a specified type
- Adding a type ascription as in `instance.myMethod: String => Int`

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
def process(x: Int): String = x.toString
def process(x: Long): String = x.toString

val result = process(1: Int | Long)
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E051] Reference Error: example.scala:4:13 
4 |val result = process(1: Int | Long)
  |             ^^^^^^^
  |             Ambiguous overload. The overloaded alternatives of method process with types
  |              (x: Long): String
  |              (x: Int): String
  |             both match arguments ((1 : Int | Long))
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Specify the exact type of the argument
def process(x: Int): String = x.toString
def process(x: Long): String = x.toString

val result = process(1: Int)
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or assign to a variable with a specific type first
def process(x: Int): String = x.toString
def process(x: Long): String = x.toString

val n: Int = 1
val result = process(n)
```

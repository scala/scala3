# E031: Sequence Wildcard Pattern Position

This error is emitted when the sequence wildcard pattern (`*`) is used in a position other than the last element in a pattern sequence.

The sequence wildcard pattern is expected at the end of an argument list. This pattern matches any remaining elements in a sequence.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
def example(list: List[Int]): Int = list match
  case List(x*, second, third) => second
  case _ => 0
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E031] Syntax Error: example.scala:2:12 
2 |  case List(x*, second, third) => second
  |            ^^
  |            * can be used only for last argument
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Place the sequence wildcard at the end
def example(list: List[Int]): Int = list match
  case List(first, second, rest*) => second
  case _ => 0
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Alternative: match the exact number of elements you need
def example(list: List[Int]): Int = list match
  case first :: second :: _ => second
  case _ => 0
```

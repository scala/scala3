# E009: Early Definitions Not Supported

This error is emitted when using early definitions (early initializers), which were a feature in Scala 2 but are no longer supported in Scala 3. Use trait parameters instead.

Earlier versions of Scala did not support trait parameters and "early definitions" 
(also known as "early initializers") were used as an alternative to initialize values
before the superclass constructor runs.

In Scala 3, trait parameters provide a cleaner solution to this problem.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
trait Logging:
  val logFile: String
  println(s"Logging to $logFile")

class App extends { val logFile = "app.log" } with Logging
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E009] Syntax Error: example.scala:5:49 
5 |class App extends { val logFile = "app.log" } with Logging
  |                                                 ^^^^
  |         Early definitions are not supported; use trait parameters instead
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use trait parameters instead of early definitions
trait Logging(logFile: String):
  println(s"Logging to $logFile")

class App extends Logging("app.log")
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Alternative: Use a lazy val to defer initialization
trait Logging:
  def logFile: String
  lazy val logger = s"Logging to $logFile"

class App extends Logging:
  val logFile = "app.log"
```

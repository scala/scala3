# E069: Cannot Have Same Name As

This error is emitted when a member has the same name as another definition in a way that creates an illegal conflict.

This typically happens when:
- A member tries to override a class definition (class definitions cannot be overridden)
- A member in a class has the same name as a member defined in a self-type reference

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
class Outer:
  class Inner

class Child extends Outer:
  override class Inner
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E069] Naming Error: example.scala:5:17 -------------------------------------
5 |  override class Inner
  |                 ^
  |class Inner cannot have the same name as class Inner in class Outer -- class definitions cannot be overridden
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Use an abstract type member with optional interface
abstract class Outer:
  trait Interface
  type Inner <: Interface

class Child extends Outer:
  class Inner extends Interface
```

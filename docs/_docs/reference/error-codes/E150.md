# E150: No Extension Method Allowed

This error is defined for cases where an extension method is incorrectly nested within another extension clause that already has collective parameters.
When an extension clause defines collective type or value parameters, the methods inside it share those parameters. Attempting to define another nested extension within such a clause is not allowed.

**Note** This error was never emitted by stable Scala 3 compiler.

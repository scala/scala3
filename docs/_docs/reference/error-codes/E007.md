# E007: Type Mismatch

This error is emitted when an expression has a different type than what is expected in that context.

The compiler found an expression of one type where a different type was expected.
This commonly occurs when:

* Assigning a value to a variable with an incompatible type annotation
* Passing an argument to a function that expects a different type
* Returning a value from a method with an incompatible return type

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
val x: String = 42
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: example.scala:1:16 
1 |val x: String = 42
  |                ^^
  |                Found:    (42 : Int)
  |                Required: String
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Convert the value to the expected type
val x: String = 42.toString
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or change the type annotation to match the value
val x: Int = 42
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use a value of the correct type
val x: String = "42"
```

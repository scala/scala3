# E114: Symbol Changed Semantics In Version

This warning is emitted when code uses a symbol that has been marked with the `@migration` annotation, indicating its semantics have changed in a specific Scala version.

The compiler message indicates:
- The symbol has changed semantics in a particular version
- The `-Xmigration` setting is used to warn about such constructs
- A migration message describes what changed

The `@migration` annotation is used internally by the Scala standard library to mark methods whose behavior has changed between Scala versions. When the `-Xmigration` compiler flag is used, it warns about uses of these methods to help with code migration.

Reproducing this warning with simple user code is difficult as `@migration` is primarily used in the standard library and requires specific `-Xmigration` flag settings.

To address this warning, review the migration message and update your code to account for the changed semantics if necessary.

**Note** `-Xmigration` was never implemented in stable Scala 3, but `@migration` annotations be found by compiler when using Scala 2.13 libraries

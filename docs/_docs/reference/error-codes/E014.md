# E014: Tuple Too Long

This error was removed before Scala 3.0.0 was released and was never emitted by the Scala 3 compiler.

## What it did

This error was triggered when creating a tuple literal with more than 22 elements.

### Example

```scala sc:nocompile
val t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23)
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E014] Syntax Error: example.scala:1:8 --------------------------------------
1 |val t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23)
  |        ^
  |        A tuple cannot have more than 22 members
```

## Explanation

In early versions of Dotty (before Scala 3.0.0), tuples were limited to 22 elements, similar to Scala 2. The error message suggested using nested tuples as a workaround:

```scala sc:nocompile
// Workaround with nested tuples (no longer needed)
val t = ((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22), (23))
```

This restriction was removed in commit 2d1427d5aa (August 2018) with "Allow tuple literals to extend beyond 22". Since Scala 3.0.0, tuples can have any number of elements without restriction.

# E083: Not A Path

This error is emitted when an expression is used where a stable path is required, but the expression is not an immutable path.

An immutable path is:
- A reference to an immutable value (`val`), or
- A reference to `this`, or
- A selection of an immutable path with an immutable value

Paths are required in certain contexts like singleton types, type projections, and some pattern matches.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
var x = 1
def example: x.type = x
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E083] Type Error: example.scala:2:13 
2 |def example: x.type = x
  |             ^^^^^^
  |             x.type is not a valid type, since it is not an immutable path
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use val instead of var for stable paths
val x = 1
def example: x.type = x
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or don't use singleton types for mutable values
var x = 1
def example: Int = x
```

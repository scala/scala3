# E123: Type Test Always Diverges

This warning is emitted when a type test (via `isInstanceOf` or pattern matching) is performed on a scrutinee whose type cannot contain any value, meaning the test can never return a result.

This typically occurs when the scrutinee has type `Nothing`, such as expressions like `???`, `throw`, or values explicitly typed as `Nothing`. Since `Nothing` has no instances, the type test will never complete - evaluating the scrutinee will always diverge before the test can be performed.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain,-Werror
def example: Boolean = ???.isInstanceOf[String]
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E123] Syntax Warning: example.scala:1:39 -----------------------------------
1 |def example: Boolean = ???.isInstanceOf[String]
  |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |This type test will never return a result since the scrutinee type (??? : => Nothing) does not contain any value.
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Use a type that can contain values
def example(x: Any): Boolean = x.isInstanceOf[String]
```

```scala sc:compile
// Or acknowledge that the code path is unreachable
def example: Boolean = ??? // Returns Nothing, no type test needed
```

# E208: Extension Has Default Receiver

This warning occurs when an extension method has a default argument for its receiver parameter. This is discouraged because the default value would never be used when the extension method is invoked as a selection on an object.

Extension methods are typically invoked as `receiver.method()`, where the receiver is always provided. A default argument for the receiver makes sense only when calling the method as a regular function, but in that case it should not be defined as an extension.

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-Werror
extension (s: String = "hello, world") def invert = s.reverse.toUpperCase
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E208] Potential Issue Warning: example.scala:1:23 --------------------------

### Explanation

The receiver cannot be omitted when an extension method is invoked as a selection.
A default argument for that parameter would never be used in that case.
An extension method can be invoked as a regular method, but if that is the intended usage,
it should not be defined as an extension.

### Solution

Remove the default argument from the receiver parameter:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
extension (s: String) def invert = s.reverse.toUpperCase
```

If you need a function with a default argument, define it as a regular method instead of an extension:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
def invert(s: String = "hello, world"): String = s.reverse.toUpperCase
```

Note that default arguments are allowed for non-receiver parameters in extension methods:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
extension (s: String)
  def combine(other: String = ", world") = s + other
```

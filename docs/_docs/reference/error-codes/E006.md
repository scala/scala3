# E006: Missing Ident

This error is emitted when a referenced identifier (value, method, type, etc.) cannot be found in the current scope.

Each identifier in Scala needs a matching declaration. There are two kinds of
identifiers: type identifiers and value identifiers. Value identifiers are introduced
by `val`, `def`, or `object` declarations. Type identifiers are introduced by `type`,
`class`, `enum`, or `trait` declarations.

Identifiers refer to matching declarations in their environment, or they can be
imported from elsewhere.

Possible reasons why no matching declaration was found:
* The declaration or the use is mis-spelt.
* An import is missing.

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
val result = unknownIdentifier
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile

```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Declare the identifier before using it
val unknownIdentifier = 42
val result = unknownIdentifier
```

```scala sc:compile
// Or import it from another scope
import scala.math.Pi
val result = Pi
```

```scala sc:compile
// Fix the spelling if it was a typo
val knownIdentifier = 42
val result = knownIdentifier
```

# E197: Inlined Anonymous Class Warning

This warning is emitted when an `inline` method creates an anonymous class. Since inline methods are expanded at each call site, the anonymous class definition will be duplicated in the generated bytecode, potentially leading to a large number of classfiles.

---

Longer explanation:

Anonymous class will be defined at each use site, which may lead to a larger number of classfiles.

To inline class definitions, you may provide an explicit class name to avoid this warning.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-Werror,-explain
inline def createObject(): Object =
  new Object {}
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E197] Potential Issue Warning: example.scala:2:2 ---------------------------
2 |  new Object {}
  |  ^
  |  New anonymous class definition will be duplicated at each inline site

```

### Solution

Use a named class inside the inline method:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
inline def createObject(): Object =
  class NamedClass extends Object
  new NamedClass
```

Or define the class outside the inline method:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
class MyObject extends Object

inline def createObject(): Object =
  new MyObject
```

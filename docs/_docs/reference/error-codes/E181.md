# E181: Unqualified Call to AnyRef Method

This warning is emitted when you make an unqualified call to an `AnyRef` or `Any` method (such as `synchronized`, `wait`, `notify`, `hashCode`, `toString`, `getClass`) at the top level of a method or function.

Top-level unqualified calls to `AnyRef` or `Any` methods are resolved to calls on `Predef` or on imported methods. This might not be what you intended, as these calls typically expect to operate on a specific object instance.

---

## Example

```scala sc:compile custom-sc:fail sc-opts:-Werror,-explain
def example(): Unit =
  synchronized {
    println("hello")
  }
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E181] Potential Issue Warning: example.scala:2:2 ---------------------------

  |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

If you intend to synchronize on a specific object, qualify the call:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
object Lock

def example(): Unit =
  Lock.synchronized {
    println("hello")
  }
```

Or if inside a class, use `this.synchronized`:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
class Counter:
  private var count = 0
  def increment(): Int = this.synchronized {
    count += 1
    count
  }
```

# E215: Named Pattern Not Applicable

This error is emitted when using named patterns in pattern matching on a type that is not a named tuple or case class.

Named patterns allow you to match elements by name (like `name = n`) rather than by position. However, this feature is only available for named tuples and case classes, which have known field names that the compiler can use for pattern matching.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
class MyClass(val name: String, val age: Int)

object MyExtractor:
  def unapply(x: MyClass): Some[(String, Int)] = Some((x.name, x.age))

def example(obj: MyClass) = obj match
  case MyExtractor(name = n, age = a) => println(s"$n is $a years old")
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E215] Pattern Match Error: example.scala:7:18 ------------------------------
7 |  case MyExtractor(name = n, age = a) => println(s"$n is $a years old")
  |       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |Named patterns cannot be used with (String, Int), because it is not a named tuple or case class
```

### Solution

Use positional pattern matching instead:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
class MyClass(val name: String, val age: Int)

object MyExtractor:
  def unapply(x: MyClass): Some[(String, Int)] = Some((x.name, x.age))

def example(obj: MyClass) = obj match
  case MyExtractor(n, a) => println(s"$n is $a years old")
```

Or use a case class which supports named patterns:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

def example(person: Person) = person match
  case Person(name = n, age = a) => println(s"$n is $a years old")
```

Named tuples also support named patterns:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
def example(data: (name: String, age: Int)) = data match
  case (name = n, age = a) => println(s"$n is $a years old")
```

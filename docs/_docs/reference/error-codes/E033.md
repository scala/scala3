# E033: Package Duplicate Symbol

This error is emitted when you try to define a package with the same name as an existing symbol (such as an object, class, or trait) in the same scope.

Package names must be unique and cannot conflict with other top-level definitions in the same compilation unit.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
object foo

package foo:
  class Bar
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E033] Naming Error: example.scala:3:8 
3 |package foo:
  |        ^^^
  |        Trying to define package with same name as object foo
```

### Solution 

Use a different package name:

```scala sc:nocompile 
package bar:
  class Bar

object foo
``` 

Alternative: rename the object to avoid conflict:

```scala sc:nocompile
package foo:
  class Bar

object myFoo
```

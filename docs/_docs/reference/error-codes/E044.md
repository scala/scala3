# E044: Overloaded Or Recursive Method Needs Result Type

This error is emitted when an overloaded or recursive method is defined without an explicit return type.

**Case 1: Overloaded methods** - If there are multiple methods with the same name and at least one definition calls another, you need to specify the calling method's return type.

**Case 2: Recursive methods** - If a method calls itself on any path (even through mutual recursion), you need to specify the return type of that method or of a definition it's mutually recursive with.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
def factorial(n: Int) = 
  if n <= 1 then 1
  else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E044] Cyclic Error: example.scala:1:4 
1 |def factorial(n: Int) = 
  |    ^^^^^^^^^
  |    Overloaded or recursive method factorial needs return type
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Add an explicit return type
def factorial(n: Int): Int = 
  if n <= 1 then 1
  else n * factorial(n - 1)
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// For mutually recursive methods, at least one needs a return type
def isEven(n: Int): Boolean = 
  if n == 0 then true else isOdd(n - 1)

def isOdd(n: Int): Boolean = 
  if n == 0 then false else isEven(n - 1)
```

# E151: Extension Method Cannot Have Type Parameters

This error occurs when an extension method defines its own type parameters while the enclosing extension clause already has type parameters.
When an extension clause has collective type parameters, all methods within it share those parameters. If a method needs additional type parameters, they should be moved to the extension clause's type parameter list instead.

**Note** This error was never emitted by stable Scala 3 compiler.

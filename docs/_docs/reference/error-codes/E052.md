# E052: Reassignment To Val

This error is emitted when attempting to reassign a value to an immutable variable declared with `val`.

You cannot assign a new value to a `val` as values cannot be changed after initialization. Reassignment is only permitted if the variable is declared with `var`.

If you're seeing this error in a boolean context, you may have accidentally used `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (equality test).

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
val x = 1
x = 2
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E052] Type Error: example.scala:2:0 
2 |x = 2
  |^^^^^
  |Reassignment to val x
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use var if you need to reassign
var x = 1
x = 2
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use a new val with a different name
val x = 1
val y = 2
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// If you meant to compare values, use ==
val x = 1
val isTwo = x == 2
```

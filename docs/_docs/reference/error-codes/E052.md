# E052: Reassignment To Val

This error is emitted when attempting to reassign a value to an immutable variable declared with `val`.

You cannot assign a new value to a `val` as values cannot be changed after initialization. Reassignment is only permitted if the variable is declared with `var`.

If you're seeing this error in a boolean context, you may have accidentally used `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (equality test).

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
def example =
  val x = 1
  x = 2
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E052] Type Error: example.scala:3:4 ----------------------------------------
3 |  x = 2
  |  ^^^^^
  |  Reassignment to val x

  | You can not assign a new value to x as values can't be changed.
  | Reassigment is only permitted if the variable is declared with `var`.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Use var if you need to reassign
def example = 
  var x = 1
  x = 2
```

```scala sc:compile
// Or use a new val with a different name
def example = 
  val x = 1
  val y = 2
```

```scala sc:compile
// If you meant to compare values, use ==
def example = 
  val x = 1
  val isTwo = x == 2
```

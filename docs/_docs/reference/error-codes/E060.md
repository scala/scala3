# E060: Abstract Member May Not Have Modifier

This error is emitted when an abstract member is declared with a modifier that is incompatible with being abstract, such as `final` or `private`.

Abstract members are meant to be implemented by subclasses, so they cannot be `final` (which prevents overriding) or `private` (which prevents access by subclasses).

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
trait Example:
  final def abstractMethod: Int
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E060] Syntax Error: example.scala:2:12 -------------------------------------
2 |  final def abstractMethod: Int
  |            ^
  |            abstract method abstractMethod may not have `final` modifier
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Remove the incompatible modifier
trait Example:
  def abstractMethod: Int
```

```scala sc:compile
// Or provide an implementation if you want final
trait Example:
  final def concreteMethod: Int = 42
```

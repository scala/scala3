# E017: Unbound Placeholder Parameter

This error is emitted when the underscore (`_`) placeholder syntax is used in a context where it cannot be bound to a parameter.

The `_` placeholder syntax was used where it could not be bound.
Consider explicitly writing the variable binding.

This can be done by replacing `_` with a variable (eg. `x`)
and adding `x =>` where applicable.

Common incorrect uses:

* Using `_` in a `val` definition instead of in a lambda
* Using `_` outside of a function context
* Using `_` without a type annotation where type cannot be inferred

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
val x = _
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile

  | The _ placeholder syntax was used where it could not be bound.
  | Consider explicitly writing the variable binding.
  |
  | This can be done by replacing _ with a variable (eg. x)
  | and adding x => where applicable.
  |
  | Example before:
  |
  | { _ }

  | Example after:
  |
  | x => { x }
  |
  | Another common occurrence for this error is defining a val with _:
  |
  | val a = _
  |
  | But this val definition isn't very useful, it can never be assigned
  | another value. And thus will always remain uninitialized.
  | Consider replacing the val with var:
  |
  | var a = _
  |
  | Note that this use of _ is not placeholder syntax,
  | but an uninitialized var definition.
  | Only fields can be left uninitialized in this manner; local variables
  | must be initialized.
  |
  | Another occurrence for this error is self type definition.
  | The _ can be replaced with this.
  |
  | Example before:
  |
  | trait A { _: B => ... 
  |
  | Example after:
  |
  | trait A { this: B => ... 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Use an explicit lambda with a named parameter
val f: Int => Int = x => x + 1
```

```scala sc:compile
// The placeholder syntax works in lambda contexts with clear types
val f: Int => Int = _ + 1
```

```scala sc:compile
// For uninitialized fields, use var (only in classes, not local scope)
class Example:
  var x: Int = scala.compiletime.uninitialized  // Uninitialized field, defaults to 0
```

```scala sc:compile
// Use wildcard in pattern matching
val list = List(1, 2, 3)
val head = list match
  case h :: _ => h
  case _ => 0
```

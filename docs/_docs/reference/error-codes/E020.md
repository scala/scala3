# E020: Yield Or Do Expected In For Comprehension

This error is emitted when a `for` comprehension without parentheses around the enumerators is missing a `yield` or `do` keyword.

When the enumerators in a for comprehension are not placed in parentheses or
braces, a `do` or `yield` statement is required after the enumerators section.

You can save some keystrokes by omitting the parentheses and writing:

```scala
val numbers = for i <- 1 to 3 yield i
```

instead of:

```scala
val numbers = for (i <- 1 to 3) yield i
```

but the `yield` keyword is still required.

For comprehensions that simply perform a side effect without yielding anything
can also be written without parentheses but a `do` keyword has to be included.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
val xs = for i <- 1 to 10 i * 2
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E020] Syntax Error: example.scala:1:30 
1 |val xs = for i <- 1 to 10 i * 2
  |                              ^
  |                              yield or do expected
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Add yield to produce a collection
val xs = for i <- 1 to 10 yield i * 2
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use do for side effects
for i <- 1 to 10 do println(i * 2)
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use parentheses (then yield is optional for producing values)
val xs = for (i <- 1 to 10) yield i * 2
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// With braces for multiple generators
val pairs = for {
  i <- 1 to 3
  j <- 1 to 3
} yield (i, j)
```

# E032: Illegal Start Of Simple Pattern

This error is emitted when the compiler encounters a token that cannot begin a valid pattern in a pattern matching context.

Simple patterns can be divided into several groups:

- **Variable Patterns**: `case x => ...` or `case _ => ...`  
  Matches any value and binds the variable name to that value. The wildcard pattern `_` is treated as if it was a fresh variable on each occurrence.

- **Typed Patterns**: `case x: Int => ...` or `case _: Int => ...`  
  Matches any value matched by the specified type and binds the variable name to that value.

- **Given Patterns**: `case given ExecutionContext => ...`  
  Matches any value matched by the specified type and binds a `given` instance to that value.

- **Literal Patterns**: `case 123 => ...` or `case 'A' => ...`  
  Matches any value that is equal to the specified literal.

- **Stable Identifier Patterns**: Using backticks to match against a variable  
  `case \`y\` => ...`

- **Constructor Patterns**: `case Person(name, age) => ...`  
  Binds all object's fields to the variable names.

- **Tuple Patterns**: `case (a, b) => ...`

- **Pattern Sequences**: `case List(first, second, rest*) => ...`

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
def example(x: Any) = x match
  case => "none"
```

  | Simple patterns can be divided into several groups:
  | - Variable Patterns: case x => ... or case _ => ...
  |   It matches any value, and binds the variable name to that value.
  |   A special case is the wild-card pattern _ which is treated as if it was a fresh
  |   variable on each occurrence.
  |
  | - Typed Patterns: case x: Int => ... or case _: Int => ...
  |   This pattern matches any value matched by the specified type; it binds the variable
  |   name to that value.
  |
  | - Given Patterns: case given ExecutionContext => ...
  |   This pattern matches any value matched by the specified type; it binds a given
  |   instance with the same type to that value.
  |
  | - Literal Patterns: case 123 => ... or case 'A' => ...
  |   This type of pattern matches any value that is equal to the specified literal.
  |
  | - Stable Identifier Patterns:
  |
  |   def f(x: Int, y: Int) = x match
  |     case `y` => ...
  |
  |   the match succeeds only if the x argument and the y argument of f are equal.
  |
  | - Constructor Patterns:
  |
  |   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
  |
  |   def test(p: Person) = p match
  |     case Person(name, age) => ...
  |
  |   The pattern binds all object's fields to the variable names (name and age, in this
  |   case).
  |
  | - Tuple Patterns:
  |
  |   def swap(tuple: (String, Int)): (Int, String) = tuple match
  |     case (text, number) => (number, text)
  |
  |   Calling:
  |
  |   swap(("Luftballons", 99))
  |
  |   would give (99, "Luftballons") as a result.
  |
  | - Pattern Sequences:
  |
  |   def getSecondValue(list: List[Int]): Int = list match
  |     case List(_, second, x*) => second
  |     case _ => 0
  |
  |   Calling:
  |
  |   getSecondValue(List(1, 10, 2))
  |
  |   would give 10 as a result.
  |   This pattern is possible because a companion object for the List class has a method
  |   with the following signature:
  |
  |   def unapplySeq[A](x: List[A]): Some[List[A]]
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Use a valid pattern - typed pattern
def example(x: Any) = x match
  case _: String => "string"
  case _ => "other"
```

```scala sc:compile
// Use a variable pattern
def example(x: Any) = x match
  case y => s"value: $y"
```

```scala sc:compile
// Use a constructor pattern
case class Person(name: String)

def example(x: Any) = x match
  case Person(name) => s"person: $name"
  case _ => "not a person"
```

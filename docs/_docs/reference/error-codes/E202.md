# E202: Quoted Type Missing

This error occurs when referencing a type parameter inside a quoted expression (`'{ ... }`) without a corresponding `Type[T]` instance in scope.

Since Scala uses type erasure at runtime, type information is lost during execution. When using macros and quotes, the compiler needs a `scala.quoted.Type[T]` instance to carry the type information into the quoted code.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
import scala.quoted.{Expr, Quotes}

case class Thing[T]()

def foo[T](using Quotes): Expr[Thing[T]] = '{ Thing[T]() }
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile

### Explanation

Referencing `T` inside a quoted expression requires a `scala.quoted.Type[T]` to be in scope.
Since Scala is subject to erasure at runtime, the type information will be missing during the execution of the code.
`scala.quoted.Type[T]` is therefore needed to carry `T`'s type information into the quoted code.
Without an implicit `scala.quoted.Type[T]`, the type `T` cannot be properly referenced within the expression.
To resolve this, ensure that a `scala.quoted.Type[T]` is available, either through a context-bound or explicitly.

### Solution

Add a context bound `T: Type` to make the type information available:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
import scala.quoted.{Expr, Quotes, Type}

case class Thing[T]()

def foo[T: Type](using Quotes): Expr[Thing[T]] = '{ Thing[T]() }
```

Alternatively, you can provide the `Type[T]` explicitly as a using parameter:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
import scala.quoted.{Expr, Quotes, Type}

case class Thing[T]()

def bar[T](using Quotes, Type[T]): Expr[Thing[T]] = '{ Thing[T]() }
```

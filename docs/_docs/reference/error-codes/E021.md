# E021: Proper Definition Not Found

This error is emitted when a `@usecase` annotation in a Scaladoc comment does not contain a proper `def` definition.

Usecases are only supported for `def`s. They exist because with Scala's
advanced type-system, we sometimes end up with seemingly scary signatures.
The usage of these methods, however, needs not be scary.

For instance, the `map` function:

```scala
List(1, 2, 3).map(2 * _) // res: List(2, 4, 6)
```

is easy to understand and use - but has a rather bulky signature:

```scala
def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[List[A], B, That]): That
```

The `@usecase` annotation allows documenting a simplified signature:

```scala
/** Map from List[A] => List[B]
 *
 * @usecase def map[B](f: A => B): List[B]
 */
def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[List[A], B, That]): That
```

## Example

```scala sc:fail
/** 
 * @usecase val x: Int
 */
def complexMethod[A, B](f: A => B)(implicit ev: Ordering[A]): B = ???
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- DocComment Error: example.scala:2:3 
2 | * @usecase val x: Int
  |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |   Proper definition was not found in @usecase
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
/** 
 * Transforms elements.
 * @usecase def transform(f: Int => Int): List[Int]
 */
def transform[A, B](f: A => B)(implicit ev: Ordering[A]): List[B] = ???
```

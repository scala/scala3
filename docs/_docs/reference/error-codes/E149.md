# E149: Illegal Redefinition Of Standard Kind

This error occurs when code in the `scala` package attempts to define a class or object with a name that is reserved for core Scala types.

Reserved names include fundamental types like `Any`, `Nothing`, `AnyRef`, `AnyVal`, `Null`, `Unit`, and other core Scala classes. These names are reserved because they are synthesized by the compiler and have special semantics that cannot be replicated by user-defined classes.

---

## Example

```scala sc:nocompile custom-sc:fail
package scala

class Any
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E149] Syntax Error: example.scala:3:6 --------------------------------------
3 |class Any
  |      ^^^
  |      illegal redefinition of standard class Any
  |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Explanation (enabled by `-explain`)
  |- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  |  "Any" is a standard Scala core `class`
  |  Please choose a different name to avoid conflicts
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

```scala sc:nocompile custom-sc:compile
package scala

// Choose a different name that doesn't conflict with reserved names
class MyAny
```

**Note:** This error can only occur when defining classes in the `scala` package. Regular user code in other packages can freely use names like `Any` without conflict, though this is generally not recommended for clarity.

# E028: Illegal Literal

This error is emitted when the parser encounters an invalid literal value that doesn't conform to Scala's literal syntax rules.

The compiler message states: **"Illegal literal"**

Available literals in Scala can be divided into several groups:
- **Integer literals**: `0`, `21`, `0xFFFFFFFF`, `-42L`
- **Floating Point Literals**: `0.0`, `1e30f`, `3.14159f`, `1.0e-100`, `.1`
- **Boolean Literals**: `true`, `false`
- **Character Literals**: `'a'`, `'\u0041'`, `'\n'`
- **String Literals**: `"Hello, World!"`
- **null**

This error is triggered during parsing when a literal token is expected but the scanner encounters something that cannot be interpreted as any valid literal type.

**Note:** This error code is active in the compiler and is triggered in the parser's `literal` and `negativeLiteral` methods. The exact conditions to reproduce this error with source code require further investigation, as the scanner typically produces different errors for malformed input.

# E182: Not Constant

This error occurs when attempting to use `constValue` (or similar compile-time operations) on a type that is not a constant type.

A constant type in Scala 3 is a type that represents a single, literal value known at compile time, such as `1`, `"hello"`, or `true`. Types like `Int`, `String`, or opaque types that cannot be resolved to a single constant value cannot be used where a constant type is required.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
import scala.compiletime.constValue

def example(): Int = constValue[Int]
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E182] Type Error: example.scala:3:32 ---------------------------------------
3 |def example(): Int = constValue[Int]
  |                                ^^^
  |                        Int is not a constant type; cannot take constValue
```

### Solution

Use a literal singleton type instead:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
import scala.compiletime.constValue

def example(): Int = constValue[42]
```

Or use a type alias that resolves to a constant type:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
import scala.compiletime.constValue

type MyConstant = 100
def example(): Int = constValue[MyConstant]
```

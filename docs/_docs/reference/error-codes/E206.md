# E206: Enum May Not Be Value Class

This error occurs when attempting to define an enum that extends `AnyVal`. Enums cannot be value classes in Scala 3.

Value classes are a mechanism for defining types that avoid runtime object allocation, but this is incompatible with the way enums are implemented in Scala 3. Enums require a class hierarchy to represent their cases, which is not possible with value classes.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
enum Orientation extends AnyVal:
  case North, South, East, West
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E206] Syntax Error: example.scala:1:5 --------------------------------------
1 |enum Orientation extends AnyVal:
  |     ^
  |     class Orientation may not be a value class
```

### Solution

Remove the `extends AnyVal` clause from the enum definition:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
enum Orientation:
  case North, South, East, West
```

If you need a lightweight representation for performance reasons, consider using an opaque type instead:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
object Orientation:
  opaque type Orientation = Int
  val North: Orientation = 0
  val South: Orientation = 1
  val East: Orientation = 2
  val West: Orientation = 3
```

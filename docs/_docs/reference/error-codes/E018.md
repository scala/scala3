# E018: Illegal Start Simple Expr

This error is emitted when the compiler expects an expression but finds a token that cannot start an expression.

An expression cannot start with certain tokens like keywords used in other contexts,
or when the expression is missing entirely. This commonly happens when:

* An expression is incomplete (missing the else branch, missing operand, etc.)
* A keyword is used where an expression is expected
* There's a syntax error that confuses the parser

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
val x = if true then 1 else
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E018] Syntax Error: example.scala:2:0 
2 |
  |^
  |expression expected but eof found
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Complete the expression
val x = if true then 1 else 2
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Ensure all branches have expressions
val result = 
  if true then
    "yes"
  else
    "no"
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Check for missing operands
val sum = 1 + 2  // not: val sum = 1 +
```

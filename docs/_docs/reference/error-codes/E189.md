# E189: Extractor Not Found

This error occurs when an extractor pattern is used with a name that does not refer to an object with an `unapply` or `unapplySeq` method.

Extractors in pattern matching require an object with an `unapply` or `unapplySeq` method that can deconstruct values. Case classes and enum cases automatically provide these extractors.

---

Longer explanation:

An application `name(...)` in a pattern can refer to an extractor which defines an `unapply` or `unapplySeq` method. Example:

```scala sc:nocompile
object split:
  def unapply(x: String) =
    val (leading, trailing) = x.splitAt(x.length / 2)
    Some((leading, trailing))

val split(fst, snd) = "HiHo"
```

The extractor pattern `split(fst, snd)` defines `fst` as the first half "Hi" and `snd` as the second half "Ho" of the right hand side "HiHo". Case classes and enum cases implicitly define extractors with the name of the class or enum case.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
def example(): Unit =
  val s(): String = "hello"
```

### Error

```

### Solution

Use a simple value binding without parentheses:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
def example(): Unit =
  val s: String = "hello"
  println(s)
```

Or if you need an extractor, define one and use it in a match:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
object MyString:
  def unapply(s: String): Option[String] = Some(s)

def example(): Unit =
  "hello" match
    case MyString(s) => println(s)
```

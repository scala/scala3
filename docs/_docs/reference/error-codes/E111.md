# E111: Bad Symbolic Reference

This error is emitted when a compiled classfile refers to a symbol that cannot be found on the current classpath.

The compiler message indicates:
- A signature in a classfile refers to a symbol that is not available
- The symbol may be completely missing from the classpath
- The classpath version might be incompatible with the version used when compiling the classfile

This error typically occurs when:
- A dependency is missing from the classpath
- A dependency version is incompatible with other compiled code
- A required classfile has been deleted or corrupted
- Binary compatibility has been broken between library versions

Reproducing this error with simple source code is difficult as it requires specific classpath conditions with missing or incompatible classfiles.

To resolve this error:
- Add the missing dependency to your classpath
- Ensure all dependency versions are compatible
- Clean and rebuild your project
- Check that all required JAR files are present and not corrupted

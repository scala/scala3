# E041: Mixed Left And Right Associative Ops

This error is emitted when operators with different associativity (left vs right) but the same precedence are used together in an expression without parentheses.

In Scala, operators ending in a colon (`:`) are right-associative. All other operators are left-associative. When two operators have the same precedence but different associativity, the compiler cannot determine the evaluation order.

Infix operator precedence is determined by the operator's first character. Characters are listed below in increasing order of precedence:
- (all letters)
- `|`
- `^`
- `&`
- `= !`
- `< >`
- `:`
- `+ -`
- `* / %`
- (all other special characters)

## Example

```scala sc:fail
extension (x: Int)
  def +: (y: Int): Int = x + y
  def +* (y: Int): Int = x * y

def example = 1 +: 2 +* 3
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E041] Syntax Error: example.scala:5:14 
5 |def example = 1 +: 2 +* 3
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^
  |              +: (which is right-associative) and +* (which is left-associative) have same precedence and may not be mixed
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use parentheses to make the order explicit
extension (x: Int)
  def +: (y: Int): Int = x + y
  def +* (y: Int): Int = x * y

def example = (1 +: 2) +* 3
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use method call syntax
extension (x: Int)
  def +: (y: Int): Int = x + y
  def +* (y: Int): Int = x * y

def example = (1.+:(2)).+*(3)
```

# E179: Match Type Scrutinee Cannot Be Higher-Kinded

This error occurs when you try to use a higher-kinded type as the scrutinee (the type being matched) in a match type definition.

Match types in Scala 3 only support proper types (types of kind `*`) as their scrutinee. Higher-kinded types (types that take type parameters, like `F[_]`) cannot be used directly as the scrutinee.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
object Test:
  type HigherKindedMatch[X[_]] = X match
    case _ => Int
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E179] Type Error: example.scala:2:33 ---------------------------------------
2 |  type HigherKindedMatch[X[_]] = X match
  |                                 ^
  |                     the scrutinee of a match type cannot be higher-kinded
```

### Solution

Use a proper type (kind `*`) as the scrutinee by applying the higher-kinded type to a type parameter:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
object Test:
  type AppliedMatch[X[_], A] = X[A] match
    case List[a] => Int
    case Option[a] => String
```

Or match on a specific applied type:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
object Test:
  type ConcreteMatch[X] = X match
    case List[a] => Int
    case Option[a] => String
```

# E100: Missing Empty Argument List

This error is emitted when a nullary method (a method with an empty parameter list `()`) is called without the empty argument list.

In Scala 3, the application syntax must follow exactly the parameter syntax. If a method is defined with `()`, it must be called with `()`. This rule doesn't apply to methods defined in Java or that override Java methods.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
def next(): Int = 42

val n = next
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E100] Type Error: example.scala:3:8 
3 |val n = next
  |        ^^^^
  |        method next must be called with () argument
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Include the empty argument list
def next(): Int = 42

val n = next()
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or define without () if no arguments are needed
def next: Int = 42

val n = next
```

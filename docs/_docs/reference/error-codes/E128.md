# E128: Member With Same Name As Static

This error occurs when a companion class defines a member with the same name as a `@static` member in the companion object.

The `@static` annotation in Scala allows members to be exposed as static members at the JVM level. When a companion object has a `@static` member, the companion class cannot have a member with the same name because this would create a naming conflict in the generated bytecode.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
import scala.annotation.static

class Example:
  val count: Int = 1

object Example:
  @static val count: Int = 0
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E128] Syntax Error: example.scala:7:14 -------------------------------------
7 |  @static val count: Int = 0
  |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |Companion classes cannot define members with same name as a @static member
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
// Rename the @static member in the companion object to avoid conflict
import scala.annotation.static

class Example:
  val count: Int = 1

object Example:
  @static val defaultCount: Int = 0
```

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
// Alternative: Rename the member in the companion class
import scala.annotation.static

class Example:
  val instanceCount: Int = 1

object Example:
  @static val count: Int = 0
```

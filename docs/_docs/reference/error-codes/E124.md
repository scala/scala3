# E124: Term Member Needs Result Type for Implicit Search

This error is emitted when a term member's definition requires an implicit search, but the implicit search cannot proceed without knowing the result type of the member first.

The right-hand side of the definition requires an implicit search at the highlighted position. To avoid this error, give the member an explicit type.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain-cyclic
def example =
  implicit val i = implicitly[Int]
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E124] Cyclic Error: example.scala:2:29 -------------------------------------
2 |  implicit val i = implicitly[Int]
  |                             ^
  |value i needs result type because its right-hand side attempts implicit search
  |
  |The error occurred while trying to compute the signature of method example
  |  which required to type the right hand side of method example since no explicit type was given
  |  which required to compute the signature of value i
  |  which required to type the right hand side of value i since no explicit type was given
  |  which required to searching for an implicit argument of type Int
  |  which required to compute the signature of value i

```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Add an explicit result type to avoid the cyclic dependency
// and ensure the implicit is available from an outer scope
given Int = 42

def example =
  val i: Int = summon[Int]
  i
```

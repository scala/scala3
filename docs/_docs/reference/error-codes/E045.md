# E045: Recursive Value Needs Result Type

This error is emitted when a recursive value definition doesn't have an explicit type annotation.

When a value references itself in its definition (either directly or through lazy evaluation), the compiler needs an explicit type to break the cycle and determine the value's type.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain-cyclic
lazy val ones = 1 #:: ones
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E045] Cyclic Error: example.scala:1:22 -------------------------------------
1 |lazy val ones = 1 #:: ones
  |                      ^
  |Recursive lazy value ones needs type
  |
  |The error occurred while trying to compute the signature of lazy value ones
  |  which required to type the right hand side of lazy value ones since no explicit type was given
  |  which required to compute the signature of lazy value ones
  |
  | Run with both -explain-cyclic and -Ydebug-cyclic to see full stack trace.

  | The definition of lazy value ones is recursive and you need to specify its type.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Add an explicit type annotation
lazy val ones: LazyList[Int] = 1 #:: ones
```

# E036: Dangling This In Path

**Note:** This error was removed before Scala 3.0.0 was released and was never emitted by the Scala 3 compiler.

## What it did

This error was triggered when using `this` at the end of an import path or type selection without selecting a member.

### Example

```scala sc:nocompile
trait Outer {
  val member: Int
  type Member
  trait Inner {
    import Outer.this 
  }
}
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E036] Syntax Error: example.scala:5:11 -------------------------------------
5 |    import Outer.this
  |           ^^^^^^^^^^
  |           Expected an additional member selection after the keyword `this`
```

## Explanation

Paths of imports and type selections must not end with the keyword `this`. The compiler expected an additional member selection after `this`.

Valid usages required selecting a member:

```scala sc:nocompile
trait Outer {
  val member: Int
  type Member
  trait Inner {
    // Valid: selecting a member after this
    import Outer.this.member
    
    // Valid: type selection
    type T = Outer.this.Member
  }
}
```

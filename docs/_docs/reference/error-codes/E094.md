title: "E094: Enum Case Definition In Non-Enum Owner"
kind: Error
until: 3.0.0
---

This error was removed before Scala 3.0.0 was released and was never emitted by the Scala 3 compiler.
This error was triggered when trying to define enum cases outside of an enum class companion object in early enum implementations.

### Example

```scala sc:nocompile
object Qux {
  case Foo
}
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- Error: example.scala:2:2 ----------------------------------------------------
2 |  case Foo
  |  ^^^^^^^^
  |case not allowed here, since owner object Qux is not an enum object
```

## Explanation

In early versions of Dotty (before Scala 3.0.0), enum cases were only allowed within the companion object of an enum class. The compiler would check that the owner of a case definition was a module class and that its linked class derived from `scala.runtime.EnumClass`.
This restriction was part of an earlier enum implementation scheme that was replaced with a new enum design in commit e1470f488b (February 2018). The new design changed how enum cases are validated and desugared, making this error obsolete.
Since Scala 3.0.0, enums use a different validation mechanism that doesn't rely on this specific error.

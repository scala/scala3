# E143: Erased Types Can Only Be Function Types

This error occurs when the `erased` keyword is used in a type context that is not a function type.

The `erased` keyword is an experimental feature that marks function parameters as erased at runtime. When used in type annotations, `erased` can only appear in function types of the form `(erased ...) => ...`.

**Note:** This error code is difficult to reproduce in practice because the parser typically reports E040 ("=> expected") before reaching this specific error. The E143 error may only be triggered in specific internal parsing paths.

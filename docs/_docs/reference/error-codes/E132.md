# E132: Static Overriding Non-Static Members

This error occurs when a `@static` member in a companion object tries to override or implement a non-static member from a parent trait or class.

The `@static` annotation causes a member to be compiled as a JVM static member. Static members cannot participate in inheritance hierarchies because they are not part of instances and cannot be dynamically dispatched. Therefore, a `@static` member cannot override or implement abstract members from parent types.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
import scala.annotation.static

trait Parent:
  def value: Int

class Child

object Child extends Parent:
  @static def value: Int = 42
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E132] Syntax Error: example.scala:9:14 -------------------------------------
9 |  @static def value: Int = 42
  |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |  @static members cannot override or implement non-static ones
```

### Solution

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
// Remove the @static annotation to allow proper implementation
import scala.annotation.static

trait Parent:
  def value: Int

class Child

object Child extends Parent:
  def value: Int = 42
```

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
// Alternative: Don't extend the trait and use a different method name
import scala.annotation.static

trait Parent:
  def value: Int

class Child

object Child:
  @static def staticValue: Int = 42
```

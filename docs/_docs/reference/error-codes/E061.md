title: "E061: Top Level Can't Be Implicit"
kind: Error
until: 3.0.0
---

This error was made inactive in Scala 3.0.0 because top-level implicits are now allowed.

This error was triggered when attempting to define an implicit value or method at the top level of a source file.

## Example

```scala sc:nocompile
package example
implicit val x: Int = 42  // error in old versions
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E061] Syntax Error: example.scala:2:0 --------------------------------------
2 |implicit val x: Int = 42
  |^
  |`implicit` modifier cannot be used for top-level definitions
```

## Explanation

In earlier versions of Scala 3, implicit definitions were required to be inside a class, object, or trait. This restriction was removed.

Since Scala 3.0.0 (specifically after PR #5754), top-level implicits are allowed and work correctly:

```scala sc:compile
// This now works in Scala 3
implicit val x: Int = 42

// Or using the modern given syntax
given Int = 42
```

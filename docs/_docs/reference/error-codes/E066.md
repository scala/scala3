# E066: Native Members May Not Have Implementation

This error is emitted when a method marked with `@native` annotation has an implementation body.

The `@native` annotation indicates that the method's implementation is provided by the runtime or a native library (like JNI). Native methods must be declared without a body because their implementation exists outside of Scala code.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
class Example:
  @native def nativeMethod(): Int = 42
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E066] Syntax Error: example.scala:4:14 
4 |  @native def nativeMethod(): Int = 42
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |              @native members may not have an implementation
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Remove the implementation from native methods
class Example:
  @native def nativeMethod(): Int
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or remove @native if you want to provide an implementation
class Example:
  def normalMethod(): Int = 42
```

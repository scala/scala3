# E001: Empty Catch Block

This error is emitted when a `try` expression has a `catch` block that does not contain any case handlers.

A `try` expression should be followed by some mechanism to handle any exceptions
thrown. Typically a `catch` expression follows the `try` and pattern matches
on any expected exceptions. For example:

```scala
try {
  println("hello")
} catch {
  case e: Exception => ???
}
```

It is also possible to follow a `try` immediately by a `finally` - letting the
exception propagate - but still allowing for some clean up in `finally`:

```scala
try {
  println("hello")
} finally {
  // perform your cleanup here!
}
```

It is recommended to use the `NonFatal` extractor to catch all exceptions as it
correctly handles transfer functions like `return`.

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-explain
def example() =
  try {
    println("hello")
  } catch { }
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile

### Solution

```scala sc:compile
// Remove redundant 'try' block
def example() =
  println("hello")
```

```scala sc:compile
// Alternative: Add a case handler to catch exceptions
import scala.util.control.NonFatal

def example() =
  try println("hello")
  catch { case NonFatal(e) => println(s"Caught: $e") }
```

```scala sc:compile
// Alternative: use finally instead if you only need cleanup
def example() =
  try println("hello")
  finally println("cleanup")
```

# E025: Identifier Expected

This error is emitted when the parser expects an identifier but finds something else, typically when an invalid token is used where a name is required.

The compiler message states: **"identifier expected"**

This can occur when:
- An invalid token is used where an identifier is expected
- A type annotation uses something that is not a valid identifier

As the compiler explains: An identifier is expected, but something else was found. This could be because the token found is not a valid identifier. As a workaround, the compiler could infer the type for you. For example, instead of using an invalid type annotation like `def foo: <invalid> = {...}`, you can write `def foo = {...}` and let the compiler infer the type.

**Note:** This error code is active in the compiler but requires specific parsing contexts that are difficult to reproduce with simple source code examples. The error is triggered in both Scala and Java source parsing when a type reference cannot be converted to a valid identifier.

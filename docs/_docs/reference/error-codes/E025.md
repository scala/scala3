# E025: Identifier Expected

This error is emitted when the compiler expects a type identifier but finds something that cannot be converted to a type identifier, such as a complex expression.

An identifier was expected, but a different construct was found. This could be because
an expression or keyword was used where a type identifier is required.

As a workaround, if the issue is in a return type position, the compiler might be
able to infer the type for you.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
class Foo extends (if true then Int else String)
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E025] Syntax Error: example.scala:1:17 
1 |class Foo extends (if true then Int else String)
  |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |                 identifier expected
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use a proper type identifier
class Foo extends AnyRef
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// For conditional types, use match types or type aliases
type MyType = Int

class Foo extends AnyRef:
  type T = MyType
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use a union type for alternatives
class Foo:
  def getValue: Int | String = 42
```

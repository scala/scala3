# E079: Only Case Class Or Case Object Allowed

**Note:** This error was removed before Scala 3.0.0 was released and was never emitted by the Scala 3 compiler.

## What it did

This error was triggered in early Dotty versions when using `case` keyword outside of a valid context.

### Example

```scala sc:nocompile
object Test:
  case Foo  // error: only case class or case object allowed
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E079] Syntax Error: example.scala:2:2 --------------------------------------
2 |  case Foo
  |  ^^^^^^^^
  |  Only `case class` or `case object` allowed
```

## Explanation

The `case` keyword can only be used in specific contexts:
- Before `class` to define a case class
- Before `object` to define a case object
- Inside `match` expressions for pattern matching
- Inside `enum` definitions for enum cases

This error was removed in commit 2e5df79218 (May 2021) as part of "Refactor remaining statement and declaration loops". The parser was refactored to handle invalid syntax differently.

The correct usages are:

```scala sc:nocompile
// Case class
case class Foo(x: Int)

// Case object
case object Bar

// Enum cases
enum Color:
  case Red, Green, Blue
```

# E064: Abstract Override Only In Traits

This error is emitted when `abstract override` is used on a member outside of a trait.

The `abstract override` modifier is only allowed for members of traits. It indicates that the member will override a concrete member from a superclass but requires further implementation when the trait is mixed into a class.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail
class Base:
  def greet: String = "Hello"

class Child extends Base:
  abstract override def greet: String = super.greet + "!"
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E064] Syntax Error: example.scala:5:2 
5 |  abstract override def greet: String = super.greet + "!"
  |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |  abstract override modifier only allowed for members of traits
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use abstract override in a trait
class Base:
  def greet: String = "Hello"

trait Greeter extends Base:
  abstract override def greet: String = super.greet + "!"

class Child extends Base with Greeter
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Or use a regular override in a class
class Base:
  def greet: String = "Hello"

class Child extends Base:
  override def greet: String = super.greet + "!"
```

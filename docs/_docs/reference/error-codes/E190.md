# E190: Pure Unit Expression

This warning is emitted when a pure non-Unit expression is discarded in a context expecting `Unit`.

When an expression of non-Unit type is used where Unit is expected, the compiler inserts a discarding conversion. If the expression is pure (has no side effects), this conversion produces no useful effect and the code is effectively equivalent to `()`.

---

Longer explanation:

As this expression is not of type Unit, it is desugared into `{ expression; () }`. Here the expression is a pure statement that can be discarded. Therefore the expression is effectively equivalent to `()`.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-Werror,-explain
def example: Unit = 42
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E190] Potential Issue Warning: example.scala:1:20 --------------------------
1 |def example: Unit = 42
  |                    ^^
  |   Discarded non-Unit value of type Int. Add `: Unit` to discard silently.

### Solution

Return Unit explicitly:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
def example: Unit = ()
```

Or change the return type if you want to return the value:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
def example: Int = 42
```

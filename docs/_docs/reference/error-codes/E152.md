# E152: Extension Can Only Have Defs

This error occurs when an extension clause with collective parameters contains something other than method definitions (`def`).
Extension clauses that have collective type or value parameters can only contain method definitions. Other declarations like `val`, `var`, `type`, or nested classes are not allowed in this context.

**Note** This error was never emitted by stable Scala 3 compiler.

# E024: Illegal Variable In Pattern Alternative

This error is emitted when a variable binding is used in a pattern alternative (`|`). Variables are not allowed in alternative patterns.

Variables are not allowed within alternate pattern matches. When you use the `|`
operator to combine patterns, each alternative must match independently, and 
Scala cannot guarantee that a variable bound in one alternative would have the
same value or even be bound in another alternative.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
def test(pair: (Int, Int)): Int = pair match
  case (1, n) | (n, 1) => n
  case _ => 0
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E024] Syntax Error: example.scala:2:9 
2 |  case (1, n) | (n, 1) => n
  |          ^
  |          Illegal variable n in pattern alternative
```

### Solution 

```scala sc:compile 
// Split into separate cases
def test(pair: (Int, Int)): Int = pair match
  case (1, n) => n
  case (n, 1) => n
  case _ => 0
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use wildcards if you don't need the value
def isEdge(pair: (Int, Int)): Boolean = pair match
  case (1, _) | (_, 1) => true
  case _ => false
``` 

```scala sc:compile 
// Use a guard for more complex conditions
def test(pair: (Int, Int)): Int = pair match
  case (a, b) if a == 1 || b == 1 => if a == 1 then b else a
  case _ => 0
```

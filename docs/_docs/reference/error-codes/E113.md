# E113: Symbol Has Unparsable Version Number

This error is emitted when a symbol marked with the `@migration` annotation has a version number that cannot be parsed.

The compiler message indicates:
- The symbol is marked with `@migration` indicating changed semantics between versions
- The `-Xmigration` setting is used to warn about constructs whose behavior may have changed
- The version number in the annotation is malformed

The `@migration` annotation is used internally by the Scala standard library to mark methods whose behavior has changed between Scala versions. When the `-Xmigration` compiler flag is used, it warns about uses of these methods.

Reproducing this error with simple user code is difficult as `@migration` is primarily used in the standard library.

To resolve this error, ensure the version number in the `@migration` annotation follows a valid format (e.g., "2.13.0").

**Note** `-Xmigration` was never implemented in stable Scala 3, but `@migration` annotations be found by compiler when using Scala 2.13 libraries

title: "E080: Expected Top Level Def"
kind: Error
until: 3.0.0
---

**Note:** This error was removed before Scala 3.0.0 was released and was never emitted by the Scala 3 compiler.

## What it did

This error was triggered in early Dotty versions when the parser expected a top-level definition but found something else.

## Example

```scala sc:nocompile
// Invalid top-level statement
42
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E080] Syntax Error: example.scala:1:0 --------------------------------------
1 |42
  |^^
  |Expected a toplevel definition
```

## Explanation

At the top level of a Scala source file, only definitions are allowed:
- `package` declarations
- `import` statements
- `class`, `trait`, `object`, `enum` definitions
- `type` aliases
- `val`, `var`, `def` definitions
- `extension` definitions
- `given` definitions
- `export` clauses

Standalone expressions like `42` or `println("hello")` are not valid at the top level (outside of a definition).

This error was removed in commit 2e5df79218 (May 2021) as part of "Refactor remaining statement and declaration loops". The parser was refactored to provide different error handling for invalid top-level syntax.

To execute code at the top level, wrap it in a main method or object:

```scala sc:compile
@main def run(): Unit =
  println("hello")

// Or
object Main:
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println("hello")
```

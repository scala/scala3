# E180: Ambiguous Extension Method

This error occurs when multiple extension methods with the same name are applicable to a type and the compiler cannot determine which one to use.

When multiple extension methods from different imports are both valid for a receiver type, the call is ambiguous and the compiler reports this error.

**Note:** This error is always reported as a nested error inside E008 (Not Found Error) because extension method resolution failures are wrapped in member lookup errors. The E180 message appears in the detailed error explanation.

## Example

```scala sc:nocompile
object Ext1:
  extension (i: Int)
    def wow: Unit = println(i)

object Ext2:
  extension (i: Int)
    def wow: Unit = println(i * 2)

def example(): Unit =
  import Ext1.wow
  import Ext2.wow
  5.wow  // error: ambiguous extension methods
```

### Error

When compiled, this produces an E008 error with the E180 ambiguous extension method message nested inside:

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E008] Not Found Error: example.scala:12:2 ----------------------------------
12 |  5.wow
   |  ^^^^^
   |  value wow is not a member of Int.
   |  An extension method was tried, but could not be fully constructed:
   |
   |      Ext2.wow(5)
   |
   |      failed with:
   |
   |          Ambiguous extension methods:
   |          both Ext2.wow(5)
   |          and  Ext1.wow(5)
   |          are possible expansions of 5.wow
```

### Solution

Disambiguate by using a qualified name:

```scala sc:nocompile
object Ext1:
  extension (i: Int)
    def wow: Unit = println(i)

object Ext2:
  extension (i: Int)
    def wow: Unit = println(i * 2)

def example(): Unit =
  import Ext1.wow
  import Ext2.wow
  Ext1.wow(5)  // explicitly call Ext1's version
```

Or import only one extension method:

```scala sc:nocompile
object Ext1:
  extension (i: Int)
    def wow: Unit = println(i)

object Ext2:
  extension (i: Int)
    def wow: Unit = println(i * 2)

def example(): Unit =
  import Ext1.wow  // only import Ext1's extension
  5.wow  // unambiguous
```

# E201: Non-Named Argument in Java Annotation

This error occurs when using positional (unnamed) arguments in a Java-defined annotation. Starting from Scala 3.6.0, named arguments are required for all Java annotations.

Java annotations don't have an exact constructor representation in Scala, and the compiler previously relied on the order of annotation fields to match positional arguments. This approach is fragile because reordering annotation fields in Java is binary-compatible but can silently change the meaning of positional arguments.

## Example

```scala sc:fail
class Foo:
  @Deprecated("reason")
  def oldMethod(): Unit = ()
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile

  | Named arguments are required for Java defined annotations

  | One possible issue with this representation is the reordering of the fields.

  |   public @interface Annotation {
  |     int a() default 41;
  |     int b() default 42;
  |   }

  | Reordering the fields is binary-compatible but it might affect the meaning of @Annotation(1)

### Solution

Use named arguments when applying Java annotations:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
class Foo:
  @Deprecated(since = "reason")
  def oldMethod(): Unit = ()
```

Alternatively, you can use the automatic rewrite feature by compiling with `-rewrite -source 3.6-migration` to automatically convert positional arguments to named arguments.

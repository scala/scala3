# E105: Trait Redefined Final Method From AnyRef

This error is intended to be emitted when a trait attempts to redefine a final method from `AnyRef` (also known as `java.lang.Object`).

The compiler message indicates:
- Traits cannot redefine final methods from `class AnyRef`
- Methods like `getClass`, `notify`, `notifyAll`, and `wait` are final in `AnyRef`

Note: While this error message class exists in the compiler, it is not currently instantiated by any code path. Attempting to redefine these methods produces different errors (such as E120 DoubleDefinitionID).

# E193: Volatile on Val

This warning is emitted when the `@volatile` annotation is applied to a `val` (immutable value).

The `@volatile` annotation is meaningful only for mutable fields (`var`) because it ensures visibility of changes across threads. Since `val` is immutable and can only be assigned once during initialization, the volatile annotation has no effect and is likely a mistake.

---

## Example

```scala sc:fail sc-opts:-Werror
class Example:
  @volatile val x: Int = 42
```

### Error

```scala sc:nocompile
-- [E193] Syntax Warning: example.scala:2:16 -----------------------------------
2 |  @volatile val x: Int = 42
  |                ^
  |                values cannot be volatile
```

### Solution

If you need a volatile field, use `var`:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
class Example:
  @volatile var x: Int = 42
```

If the value should be immutable, remove the `@volatile` annotation:

```scala sc:compile sc-opts:-Werror
class Example:
  val x: Int = 42
```

Context parameters can be declared by-name to avoid a divergent inferred expansion. Example:

```scala
trait Codec[T]:
  def write(x: T): Unit

given intCodec: Codec[Int] = ???

given optionCodec: [T] => (ev: => Codec[T]) => Codec[Option[T]]:
  def write(xo: Option[T]) = xo match
    case Some(x) => ev.write(x)
    case None =>

val s = summon[Codec[Option[Int]]]

s.write(Some(33))
s.write(None)
```
As is the case for a normal by-name parameter, the argument for the context parameter `ev`
is evaluated on demand. In the example above, if the option value `x` is `None`, it is
not evaluated at all.

The synthesized argument for a context parameter is backed by a local val
if this is necessary to prevent an otherwise diverging expansion.

The precise steps for synthesizing an argument for a by-name context parameter of type `=> T` are as follows.

 1. Create a new given of type `T`:

    ```scala
    given lv: T = ???
    ```

    where `lv` is an arbitrary fresh name.

 1. This given is not immediately available as candidate for argument inference (making it immediately available could result in a loop in the synthesized computation). But it becomes available in all nested contexts that look again for an argument to a by-name context parameter.

 1. If this search succeeds with expression `E`, and `E` contains references to `lv`, replace `E` by

    ```scala
    { given lv: T = E; lv }
    ```

    Otherwise, return `E` unchanged.

In the example above, the definition of `s` would be expanded as follows.

```scala
val s = summon[Test.Codec[Option[Int]]](
  using optionCodec[Int](using intCodec)
)
```

No local given instance was generated because the synthesized argument is not recursive.

The compiler expands enums and their cases to code that only uses
Scala's other language features. As such, enums in Scala are
convenient _syntactic sugar_, but they are not essential to understand
Scala's core.

We now explain the expansion of enums in detail. First,
some terminology and notational conventions:

 - We use `E` as a name of an enum, and `C` as a name of a case that appears in `E`.
 - We use `<...>` for syntactic constructs that in some circumstances might be empty. For instance,
   `<value-params>` represents one or more parameter lists `(...)` or nothing at all.

 - Enum cases fall into three categories:

   - _Class cases_ are those cases that are parameterized, either with a type parameter section `[...]` or with one or more (possibly empty) parameter sections `(...)`.
   - _Simple cases_ are cases of a non-generic enum that have neither parameters nor an extends clause or body. That is, they consist of a name only.
   - _Value cases_ are all cases that do not have a parameter section but that do have a (possibly generated) `extends` clause and/or a body.

  Simple cases and value cases are collectively called _singleton cases_.

The desugaring rules imply that class cases are mapped to case classes, and singleton cases are mapped to `val` definitions.

There are nine desugaring rules. Rule (1) desugars enum definitions. Rules
(2) and (3) desugar simple cases. Rules (4) to (6) define `extends` clauses for cases that
are missing them. Rules (7) to (9) define how such cases with `extends` clauses
map into `case class`es or `val`s.

1. An `enum` definition
   ```scala
   enum E ... { <defs> <cases> }
   ```
   expands to a `sealed abstract` class that extends the `scala.reflect.Enum` trait and
   an associated companion object that contains the defined cases, expanded according
   to rules (2 - 8). The enum class starts with a compiler-generated import that imports
   the names `<caseIds>` of all cases so that they can be used without prefix in the class.
   ```scala
   sealed abstract class E ... extends <parents> with scala.reflect.Enum {
     import E.{ <caseIds> }
     <defs>
   }
   object E { <cases> }
   ```

2. A simple case consisting of a comma-separated list of enum names
   ```scala
   case C_1, ..., C_n
   ```
   expands to
   ```scala
   case C_1; ...; case C_n
   ```
   Any modifiers or annotations on the original case extend to all expanded
   cases.

3. A simple case
   ```scala
   case C
   ```
   of an enum `E` that does not take type parameters expands to
   ```scala
   val C = $new(n, "C")
   ```
   Here, `$new` is a private method that creates an instance of `E` (see
   below).

4. If `E` is an enum with type parameters
   ```scala
   V1 T1 >: L1 <: U1 ,   ... ,    Vn Tn >: Ln <: Un      (n > 0)
   ```
   where each of the variances `Vi` is either `'+'` or `'-'`, then a simple case
   ```scala
   case C
   ```
   expands to
   ```scala
   case C extends E[B1, ..., Bn]
   ```
   where `Bi` is `Li` if `Vi = '+'` and `Ui` if `Vi = '-'`. This result is then further
   rewritten with rule (8). Simple cases of enums with non-variant type
   parameters are not permitted (however value cases with explicit `extends` clause are)

5. A class case without an extends clause
   ```scala
   case C <type-params> <value-params>
   ```
   of an enum `E` that does not take type parameters expands to
   ```scala
   case C <type-params> <value-params> extends E
   ```
   This result is then further rewritten with rule (9).

6. If `E` is an enum with type parameters `Ts`, a class case with neither type parameters nor an extends clause
   ```scala
   case C <value-params>
   ```
   expands to
   ```scala
   case C[Ts] <value-params> extends E[Ts]
   ```
   This result is then further rewritten with rule (9). For class cases that have type parameters themselves, an extends clause needs to be given explicitly.

7. If `E` is an enum with type parameters `Ts`, a class case without type parameters but with an extends clause
   ```scala
   case C <value-params> extends <parents>
   ```
   expands to
   ```scala
   case C[Ts] <value-params> extends <parents>
   ```
   provided at least one of the parameters `Ts` is mentioned in a parameter type in
   `<value-params>` or in a type argument in `<parents>`.

8. A value case
   ```scala
   case C extends <parents>
   ```
   expands to a value definition in `E`'s companion object:
   ```scala
   val C = new <parents> { <body>; def ordinal = n }
   ```
   where `n` is the ordinal number of the case in the companion object,
   starting from 0. The anonymous class also
   implements the abstract `Product` methods that it inherits from `Enum`.

   It is an error if a value case refers to a type parameter of the enclosing `enum`
   in a type argument of `<parents>`.

9. A class case
   ```scala
   case C <params> extends <parents>
   ```
   expands analogous to a final case class in `E`'s companion object:
   ```scala
   final case class C <params> extends <parents>
   ```
   The enum case defines an `ordinal` method of the form
   ```scala
   def ordinal = n
   ```
   where `n` is the ordinal number of the case in the companion object,
   starting from 0.

   It is an error if a value case refers to a type parameter of the enclosing `enum`
   in a parameter type in `<params>` or in a type argument of `<parents>`, unless that parameter is already
   a type parameter of the case, i.e. the parameter name is defined in `<params>`.

   The compiler-generated `apply` and `copy` methods of an enum case
   ```scala
   case C(ps) extends P1, ..., Pn
   ```
   are treated specially. A call `C(ts)` of the apply method is ascribed the underlying type
   `P1 & ... & Pn` (dropping any [transparent traits](../other-new-features/transparent-traits.html))
   as long as that type is still compatible with the expected type at the point of application.
   A call `t.copy(ts)` of `C`'s `copy` method is treated in the same way.

### Translation of Enums with Singleton Cases

An enum `E` (possibly generic) that defines one or more singleton cases
will define the following additional synthetic members in its companion object (where `E'` denotes `E` with
any type parameters replaced by wildcards):

   - A method `valueOf(name: String): E'`. It returns the singleton case value whose identifier is `name`.
   - A method `values` which returns an `Array[E']` of all singleton case
     values defined by `E`, in the order of their definitions.

If `E` contains at least one simple case, its companion object will define in addition:

   - A private method `$new` which defines a new simple case value with given
     ordinal number and name. This method can be thought as being defined as
     follows.

     ```scala
     private def $new(_$ordinal: Int, $name: String) =
       new E with runtime.EnumValue:
         def ordinal = _$ordinal
         override def productPrefix = $name // if not overridden in `E`
         override def toString = $name      // if not overridden in `E`
     ```

The anonymous class also implements the abstract `Product` methods that it inherits from `Enum`.
The `ordinal` method is only generated if the enum does not extend from `java.lang.Enum` (as Scala enums do not extend
`java.lang.Enum`s unless explicitly specified). In case it does, there is no need to generate `ordinal` as
`java.lang.Enum` defines it. Similarly there is no need to override `toString` as that is defined in terms of `name` in
`java.lang.Enum`. Finally, `productPrefix` will call `this.name` when `E` extends `java.lang.Enum`.

### Scopes for Enum Cases

A case in an `enum` is treated similarly to a secondary constructor. It can access neither the enclosing `enum` using `this`, nor its value parameters or instance members using simple
identifiers.

Even though translated enum cases are located in the enum's companion object, referencing
this object or its members via `this` or a simple identifier is also illegal. The compiler typechecks enum cases in the scope of the enclosing companion object but flags any such illegal accesses as errors.

### Translation of Java-compatible enums

A Java-compatible enum is an enum that extends `java.lang.Enum`. The translation rules are the same as above, with the reservations defined in this section.

It is a compile-time error for a Java-compatible enum to have class cases.

Cases such as `case C` expand to a `@static val` as opposed to a `val`. This allows them to be generated as static fields of the enum type, thus ensuring they are represented the same way as Java enums.

### Other Rules

- A normal case class which is not produced from an enum case is not allowed to extend
  `scala.reflect.Enum`. This ensures that the only cases of an enum are the ones that are
  explicitly declared in it.

- If an enum case has an `extends` clause, the enum class must be one of the
  classes that's extended.

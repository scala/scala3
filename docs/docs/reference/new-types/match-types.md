A match type reduces to one of its right-hand sides, depending on the type of
its scrutinee. For example:

```scala
type Elem[X] = X match
  case String => Char
  case Array[t] => t
  case Iterable[t] => t
```

This defines a type that reduces as follows:

```scala
Elem[String]       =:=  Char
Elem[Array[Int]]   =:=  Int
Elem[List[Float]]  =:=  Float
Elem[Nil.type]     =:=  Nothing
```

Here `=:=` is understood to mean that left and right-hand sides are mutually
subtypes of each other.

In general, a match type is of the form

```scala
S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn }
```

where `S`, `T1`, ..., `Tn` are types and `P1`, ..., `Pn` are type patterns. Type
variables in patterns start with a lower case letter, as usual.

Match types can form part of recursive type definitions. Example:

```scala
type LeafElem[X] = X match
  case String => Char
  case Array[t] => LeafElem[t]
  case Iterable[t] => LeafElem[t]
  case AnyVal => X
```

Recursive match type definitions can also be given an upper bound, like this:

```scala
type Concat[Xs <: Tuple, +Ys <: Tuple] <: Tuple = Xs match
  case EmptyTuple => Ys
  case x *: xs => x *: Concat[xs, Ys]
```

In this definition, every instance of `Concat[A, B]`, whether reducible or not,
is known to be a subtype of `Tuple`. This is necessary to make the recursive
invocation `x *: Concat[xs, Ys]` type check, since `*:` demands a `Tuple` as its
right operand.

## Dependent Typing

Match types can be used to define dependently typed methods. For instance, here
is the value level counterpart to the `LeafElem` type defined above (note the
use of the match type as the return type):

```scala
def leafElem[X](x: X): LeafElem[X] = x match
  case x: String      => x.charAt(0)
  case x: Array[t]    => leafElem(x(9))
  case x: Iterable[t] => leafElem(x.head)
  case x: AnyVal      => x
```

This special mode of typing for match expressions is only used when the
following conditions are met:

1. The match expression patterns do not have guards
2. The match expression scrutinee's type is a subtype of the match type
   scrutinee's type
3. The match expression and the match type have the same number of cases
4. The match expression patterns are all [Typed Patterns](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/08-pattern-matching.html#typed-patterns),
   and these types are `=:=` to their corresponding type patterns in the match
   type

## Representation of Match Types

The internal representation of a match type
```
S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn }
```
is `Match(S, C1, ..., Cn) <: B` where each case `Ci` is of the form
```
[Xs] =>> P => T
```

Here, `[Xs]` is a type parameter clause of the variables bound in pattern `Pi`.
If there are no bound type variables in a case, the type parameter clause is
omitted and only the function type `P => T` is kept. So each case is either a
unary function type or a type lambda over a unary function type.

`B` is the declared upper bound of the match type, or `Any` if no such bound is
given.  We will leave it out in places where it does not matter for the
discussion. The scrutinee, bound, and pattern types must all be first-order
types.

## Match Type Reduction

Match type reduction follows the semantics of match expressions, that is, a
match type of the form `S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn }` reduces to `Ti` if
and only if `s: S match { _: P1 => T1 ... _: Pn => Tn }` evaluates to a value of
type `Ti` for all `s: S`.

The compiler implements the following reduction algorithm:

- If the scrutinee type `S` is an empty set of values (such as `Nothing` or
  `String & Int`), do not reduce.
- Sequentially consider each pattern `Pi`
    - If `S <: Pi` reduce to `Ti`.
    - Otherwise, try constructing a proof that `S` and `Pi` are disjoint, or, in
      other words, that no value `s` of type `S` is also of type `Pi`.
    - If such proof is found, proceed to the next case (`Pi+1`), otherwise, do
      not reduce.

Disjointness proofs rely on the following properties of Scala types:

1. Single inheritance of classes
2. Final classes cannot be extended
3. Constant types with distinct values are nonintersecting
4. Singleton paths to distinct values are nonintersecting, such as `object` definitions or singleton enum cases.

Type parameters in patterns are minimally instantiated when computing `S <: Pi`.
An instantiation `Is` is _minimal_ for `Xs` if all type variables in `Xs` that
appear covariantly and nonvariantly in `Is` are as small as possible and all
type variables in `Xs` that appear contravariantly in `Is` are as large as
possible.  Here, "small" and "large" are understood with respect to  `<:`.

For simplicity, we have omitted constraint handling so far. The full formulation
of subtyping tests describes them as a function from a constraint and a pair of
types to either _success_ and a new constraint or _failure_. In the context of
reduction, the subtyping test `S <: [Xs := Is] P` is understood to leave the
bounds of all variables in the input constraint unchanged, i.e. existing
variables in the constraint cannot be instantiated by matching the scrutinee
against the patterns.

## Subtyping Rules for Match Types

The following rules apply to match types. For simplicity, we omit environments
and constraints.

1. The first rule is a structural comparison between two match types:

   ```
   S match { P1 => T1 ... Pm => Tm }  <:  T match { Q1 => U1 ... Qn => Un }
   ```

   if

   ```
   S =:= T,  m >= n,  Pi =:= Qi and Ti <: Ui for i in 1..n
   ```

   I.e. scrutinees and patterns must be equal and the corresponding bodies must
   be subtypes. No case re-ordering is allowed, but the subtype can have more
   cases than the supertype.

2. The second rule states that a match type and its redux are mutual subtypes.

   ```
   S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn }  <:  U
   U  <:  S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn }
   ```

   if

   `S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn }` reduces to `U`

3. The third rule states that a match type conforms to its upper bound:

   ```
   (S match { P1 => T1 ... Pn => Tn } <: B)  <:  B
   ```

## Termination

Match type definitions can be recursive, which means that it's possible to run
into an infinite loop while reducing match types.

Since reduction is linked to subtyping, we already have a cycle detection
mechanism in place. As a result, the following will already give a reasonable
error message:

```scala
type L[X] = X match
  case Int => L[X]

def g[X]: L[X] = ???
```

```scala
   |  val x: Int = g[Int]
   |                ^
   |Recursion limit exceeded.
   |Maybe there is an illegal cyclic reference?
   |If that's not the case, you could also try to
   |increase the stacksize using the -Xss JVM option.
   |A recurring operation is (inner to outer):
   |
   |  subtype LazyRef(Test.L[Int]) <:< Int
```

Internally, the Scala compiler detects these cycles by turning selected stack overflows into
type errors. If there is a stack overflow during subtyping, the exception will
be caught and turned into a compile-time error that indicates a trace of the
subtype tests that caused the overflow without showing a full stack trace.

## Variance Laws for Match Types

**Note:** This section does not reflect the current implementation.

Within a match type `Match(S, Cs) <: B`, all occurrences of type variables count
as covariant. By the nature of the cases `Ci` this means that occurrences in
pattern position are contravariant (since patterns are represented as function
type arguments).

## Related Work

Match types have similarities with
[closed type families](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families) in Haskell.
Some differences are:

- Subtyping instead of type equalities.
- Match type reduction does not tighten the underlying constraint, whereas type
  family reduction does unify. This difference in approach mirrors the
  difference between local type inference in Scala and global type inference in
  Haskell.

Match types are also similar to Typescript's
[conditional types](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/21316). The
main differences here are:

 - Conditional types only reduce if both the scrutinee and pattern are ground,
   whereas match types also work for type parameters and abstract types.
 - Match types support direct recursion.
 - Conditional types distribute through union types.

Hello! We are excited to announce 0.24.0-RC1 of Dotty. In this version, we have updated the standard library to 2.13.2. Also, we have made some work to make error messages more user-friendly and a bunch of other polishings to the language.

You can try out this version right now, from the comfort of your SBT, by visiting the [home page](https://dotty.epfl.ch/) and scrolling down to the "Create a Dotty Project" section.

Alternatively, you can try this version of Scala online via [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/). Once you're there, click "Build Settings" and set "Target" to "Dotty".

Enjoy the ride🚀!

# REPL works with indented code
REPL now supports indented code. Consider the following snippet:

```scala
scala> if true then
     |   print(1)
     |   print(2)
     |
```

Previously, the REPL would have stopped after `print(1)`. Now, it waits either for an `else` block or an extra newline to indicate the end of the expression. The above example will output `12` as expected.

# Better error message for ifs that miss an else branch
The error messages are now more beginner-friendly. Consider the following:

```scala
def f: Int = if ??? then 1
```

Above, the `if` expression returns a `Unit` since an `else` clause is missing. Previously, the user would have gotten the following error:

```
-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: ...
12 |def f: Int = if ??? then 1
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |             Found:    Unit
   |             Required: Int
```

Now, the above error message also contains the following sentence:

```
   |             Maybe you are missing an else part for the conditional?
```

We hope this change will make the language more intuitive for new users.

# Inline overrides
Inline overrides are now supported. For example, consider the following code:

```scala
abstract class A:
  def f(x: Int) = s"Foo $x"

class B extends A:
  inline override def f(x: Int) = s"Bar $x"

@main def Test =
  val b = B()
  println(b.f(22))
  val a: A = b
  println(a.f(22))
```

The output of the above program is:

```
Bar 22
Bar 22
```

This new change, however, comes with rather intricated rules – if you are interested to learn about them in details, see [documentation](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/metaprogramming/inline.html#rules-for-overriding) on inlines and the PR #[8543](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/8543/files) which introduced the change.

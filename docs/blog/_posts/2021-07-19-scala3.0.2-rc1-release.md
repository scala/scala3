Greetings from the Scala 3 team! We are glad to announce that Scala 3.0.1 and 3.0.2-RC1 are now officially out.
As no critical bugs have been found in the previously released Scala 3.0.1-RC2, it has been promoted to 3.0.1, which is the first stable release after 3.0.0. Scala 3.0.2-RC1, in turn, incorporates new language improvements and bug fixes.

# Improved insertion of semicolons in logical conditions

Scala 3's indentation based syntax is aimed at making your code more concise and readable. As it gets broader adoption, we consistently improve its specification to eliminate corner cases which might lead to ambiguities or counterintuitive behaviours.

Thanks to [#12801](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/12801) it is now allowed for a logical expression in an `if` statement or expression to continue in the following line if it starts in the same line as the `if` keyword, e.g.

```scala
if foo
  (bar)
then //...
```

can now be used instead of

```scala
if foo(bar)
then //...
```

If yor intention is to have a block of code evaluating into a sigle condition you should add a new line and indentation directly after `if` , e.g.

```scala
if
  val cond = foo(bar)
  cond
then //...
```

so code like below would NOT be valid

```scala
if val cond = foo(bar)
  cond
then //...
```

# Towards better null safety in the type system

The compiler option `-Yexplicit-nulls` modifies Scala's standard type hierarchy to allow easier tracing of nullable values by performing strict checks directly on the level of the type system rather than just relying of conventions (e.g. this prevents you from writing code like `val foo: Option[String] = Some(null)`, which would be otherwise valid Scala although very likely to cause a `NullPointerException` at some further point).

After the recently introduced changes with this option enabled the `Null` type becomes a subtype of `Matchable` instead of inheriting directly from `Any`, making the code below compile (this used to compile before only without strict nullability checking).

```scala
def foo[T <: Matchable](t: T) = t match { case null => () }
```

# Method search by type signature

You can now browse the documentation of Scala's API not only by names of methods but also by their type in a Hoogle-like manner thanks to integration with [Inkuire](https://github.com/VirtusLab/Inkuire) brought up by [#12375](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/12375).

To find a method with a specified signature simply write in scaladoc's searchbar the type you would expect it to have after eta-expansion (as if this was a function rather than a method).

# Typing escape hatch for structural types

Structural types may come in handy in many situations, e.g. when one wants to achieve a compromise between safety of static typing and ease of use when dealing with dynamically changing schemas of domain data structures. They have however some limitations. Among others structural typing doesn't normally play well with method overloading because some types of reflective dispatch algorithms (inlcuding JVM reflection) might not be able to choose the overloaded method alternative with the right signature without knowing upfront the exact types of the parameters after erasure. Consider the following snippet.

```scala
class Sink[A] { def put(x: A): Unit = {} }
val a = Sink[String]()
val b: { def put(x: String): Unit } = a
```

This code won't compile. This is because when `Sink[String]` gets erased to `Sink[Object]` (as it's seen from from JVM's perspective) the method's signature becomes `put(x: Object): Unit` while for the structural type it remains unchanged as `put(x: String): Unit` and they wouldn't match in runtime therefore `Sink[String]` cannot be treated as a subtype of `{ def put(x: String): Unit }`.

We might however try to write a better method dispatch algorithm ourselves instead of relying on the JVM's default one to make this work. To assure the compiler that we know what we're doing we'll need to use the new `Selectable.WithoutPreciseParameterTypes` marker trait. Currently it's an experimental feature (introduced by [#12268](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/12268)) so you'll be able to use it only with a snapshot or nightly version of the compiler and you'll need to annotate all subtypes of this trait with `@experimental`.

```scala
import annotation.experimental

@experimental trait MultiMethodSelectable extends Selectable.WithoutPreciseParameterTypes:
  // smartly choose the right method implementation to call
  def applyDynamic(name: String, paramTypes: Class[_]*)(args: Any*): Any = ???

@experimental class Sink[A] extends MultiMethodSelectable:
  def put(x: A): Unit = {}

val a = new Sink[String]
val b: MultiMethodSelectable { def put(x: String): Unit } = a
```

This snippet will compile as the compiler won't perform the precise signature check for `b` anymore.

# Metaprogramming

# run the tests on a project with pipelining
# exercises the fact that -Ypickle-java and -Ypickle-write
# flags are set twice.
# steps:
# - Compile scope is compiled with flags `-Ypickle-java -Ypickle-write early/a-early-7423784.jar`
# - sbt copies `early/a-early-7423784.jar` to `early/a-early.jar`
# - Test scope is compiled with flags `-Ypickle-java -Ypickle-write early-test/a-early-963232.jar -Ypickle-java -Ypickle-write early/a-early.jar -classpath early/a-early.jar`
# e.g. for some reason the classpath has the same `a-early.jar` that
# is passed with `Ypickle-write`.
# Therefore we MUST avoid even reading the second `-Ypickle-write` setting,
# otherwise we will zero-out `a-early.jar`, causing type errors because its contents are blank.

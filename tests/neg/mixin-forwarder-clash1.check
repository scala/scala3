15 |class Bar2 extends Bar1 with Two[Foo] // error
   |      ^
   |      Name clash between inherited members:
   |      def concat(suffix: Int): X in trait One at line 4 and
   |      def concat[Dummy](suffix: Int): Y in trait Two at line 8
   |      have the same type (suffix: Int): Object after erasure.

   |      Consider adding a @targetName annotation to one of the conflicting definitions
   |      for disambiguation.

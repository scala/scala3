  | g is used before you define it, and the definition of x
  | appears between that use and the definition of g.
  |
  | Forward references are allowed only if there are no value definitions between
  | the reference and the definition that is referred to.
  | Specifically, any statement between the reference and the definition
  | cannot be a variable definition, and if it's a value definition, it must be lazy.
  |
  | Define g before it is used,
  | or move the definition of x so it does not appear between
  | the declaration of g and its use,
  | or define x as lazy.

   |              Cyclic reference involving class Context

   |              The error occurred while trying to compute the base classes of class Context
   |                which required to compute the base classes of trait TyperOps
   |                which required to compute the signature of trait TyperOps
   |                which required to elaborate the export clause export unification.requireSubtype
   |                which required to compute the signature of value unification
   |                which required to type the right hand side of value unification since no explicit type was given
   |                which required to compute the base classes of class Context

-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg/print-tuple-union.scala:3:23 --------------------------------------------------
3 |  def bar[B]: Int = foo[B] // error
  |                    ^^^^^^
  |                    Found:    Tuple.Union[B]
  |                    Required: Int
  |
  |                    Note: a match type could not be fully reduced:
  |
  |                      trying to reduce  Tuple.Union[B]
  |                      trying to reduce  Tuple.Fold[B, Nothing, [x, y] =>> x | y]
  |                      failed since selector B
  |                      does not match  case EmptyTuple => Nothing
  |                      and cannot be shown to be disjoint from it either.
  |                      Therefore, reduction cannot advance to the remaining case
  |
  |                        case x *: xs => x | Tuple.Fold[xs, Nothing, [x, y] =>> x | y]

   |      But Failed to synthesize an instance of type scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[A]:
   |      	* class Nothing is not a generic product because it is not a case class
   |      	* class Nothing is not a generic sum because it is not a sealed class
   |
   |      where:    A is a type variable with constraint <: Payload[A]

-- [E203] Syntax Migration Warning: tests/warn/21770.scala:7:9 ---------------------------------------------------------
7 |  f(i => (cache = Some(i))) // warn
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |         Deprecated syntax: in the future it would be interpreted as a named tuple with one element,
  |         not as an assignment.
  |
  |         To assign a value, use curly braces: `{cache = Some(i)}`.
  |         This can be rewritten automatically under -rewrite -source 3.6-migration.

  |                        because it is not defined before the search position.
  |                      Result with new rules: a.
  |                      To opt into the new rules, compile with `-source future` or use
  |                      the `scala.language.future` language import.
  |
  |                      To fix the problem without the language import, you could try one of the following:
  |                        - use a `given ... with` clause as the enclosing given,
  |                        - rearrange definitions so that ab comes earlier,
  |                        - use an explicit argument.
  |                      This will be an error in Scala 3.5 and later.

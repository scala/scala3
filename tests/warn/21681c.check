-- [E203] Syntax Migration Warning: tests/warn/21681c.scala:7:2 --------------------------------------------------------
7 |  (age = 29) // warn
  |  ^^^^^^^^^^
  |  Deprecated syntax: in the future it would be interpreted as a named tuple with one element,
  |  not as an assignment.
  |
  |  To assign a value, use curly braces: `{age = 29}`.
  |  This can be rewritten automatically under -rewrite -source 3.6-migration.

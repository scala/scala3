   |Required: (l²: scala.caps.Capability^) ?-> (f: File^{l²}) => Unit

   |Note that capability `l` is not included in capture set {o.any}
   |because (l : scala.caps.Capability) is not visible from o.any in value o.

   |where:    => refers to a root capability created in method test when checking argument to parameter op of method withFile
   |          ^  refers to the root capability caps.any
   |          l  is a reference to a value parameter
   |          l² is a reference to a value parameter

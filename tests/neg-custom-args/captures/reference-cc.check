   |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:

   |Found:    () ->{canThrow$1} Double
   |Required: () ->{any} Double
   |
   |Note that capability `canThrow$1` is not included in capture set {any}
   |because (canThrow$1 : CanThrow[LimitExceeded]) in an enclosing try expression is not visible from any in method escaped.
   |
   |where:    any is a root capability in the result type of method escaped

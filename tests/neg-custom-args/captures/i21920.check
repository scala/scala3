-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg-custom-args/captures/i21920.scala:34:35 ---------------------------------------
34 |  val cell: Cell[File] = File.open(f => Cell(() => Seq(f))) // error

   |Capability `fresh` outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by an enclosing function.
   |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
   |
   |Found:    (f: File^'s2) ->'s3 Cell[File^'s4]{val head: () ->'s5 IterableOnce[File^'s6]^'s7}^'s8
   |Required: File^ => Cell[File^'s9]{val head: () ->'s10 IterableOnce[File^'s11]^'s12}^'s13
   |
   |where:    =>    refers to a root capability created in value cell when checking argument to parameter f of method open
   |          ^     refers to the root capability caps.any
   |          fresh is a root capability associated with the result type of (): IterableOnce[File^'s1]^²

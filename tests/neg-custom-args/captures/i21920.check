-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg-custom-args/captures/i21920.scala:34:35 ---------------------------------------
34 |  val cell: Cell[File] = File.open(f => Cell(() => Seq(f))) // error
   |                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |Capability `f` outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by value cell.
   |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
   |
   |Found:    (f: File^) ->'s2 Cell[File^{f}]{val head: () ->'s3 IterableOnce[File^{f}]^'s4}^'s5
   |Required: File^ => Cell[File^'s1]{val head: () ->'s6 IterableOnce[File^]^'s7}^'s8
   |
   |where:    => refers to a root capability created in value cell when checking argument to parameter f of method open
   |          ^  refers to the root capability caps.any

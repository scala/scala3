-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg-custom-args/captures/freeze.scala:19:4 ----------------------------------------
18 |  val a2 = freeze:
19 |    val a = Arr[String](2)  // error
   |           ^
   |Capability cap outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 of value a2.
   |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
   |
   |Found:    (Arr[String]^{cap}, Arr[String]^{cap²})^'s2
   |Required: (Arr[String]^'s1, Arr[String]^'s3)^'s4
   |
   |where:    cap and cap² refer to a root capability associated with the result type of (): (Arr[String]^, Arr[String]^²)^'s2
20 |    val b = Arr[String](2)
21 |    a(0) = "1"
22 |    a(1) = "2"
23 |    b(0) = "1"
24 |    b(1) = "2"
25 |    (a, b)

   |  The result of `try` cannot have type () => Unit since
   |  that type captures the root capability `cap`.
   |  This is often caused by a locally generated exception capability leaking as part of its result.

   |  where:    => refers to a fresh root capability classified as Control in the type of given instance canThrow$1

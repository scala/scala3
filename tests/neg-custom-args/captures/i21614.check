   |Capability `_$1` outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by method mkLoggers2.
   |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
   |
   |Found:    (_$1: File^{C}) ->{C} Logger{val f: File^{_$1}}^{_$1}
   |Required: File^{C} => Logger{val f: File^'s2}^'s1
   |
   |where:    => refers to a root capability created in method mkLoggers2 when checking argument to parameter f of method map

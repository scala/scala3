   |      Capability cap outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by value x1.
   |      The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
   |
   |      Found:    (Ref^{cap}, Ref^{cap²})^'s2
   |      Required: (Ref^'s1, Ref^'s3)^'s4
   |
   |      where:    cap and cap² refer to a root capability associated with the result type of (): (Ref^, Ref^²)^'s2
16 |    val t2 = allocRef()
17 |    (t1, t2)

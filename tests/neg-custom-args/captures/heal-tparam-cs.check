   |Capability c outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by value test1.
   |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
   |
   |Found:    (c: Capp^'s2) ->'s3 () ->{c} Unit
   |Required: (c: Capp^) => () ->'s1 Unit
   |
   |where:    => refers to a root capability created in value test1 when checking argument to parameter op of method localCap
   |          ^  refers to the universal root capability
   |

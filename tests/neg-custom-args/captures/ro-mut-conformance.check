   |  cannot call update method set from (a : Ref),

   |                     Found:    (a : Ref)

   |                     where:    ^ refers to a fresh root capability in the type of value t
   |
   |                     Note that {cap} is an exclusive capture set of the mutable type Ref^,
   |                     it cannot subsume a read-only capture set of the mutable type (a : Ref).

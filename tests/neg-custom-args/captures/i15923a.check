-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg-custom-args/captures/i15923a.scala:7:21 ---------------------------------------
7 |  val leak = withCap(lcap => () => mkId(lcap)) // error
  |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |Capability `lcap` outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by value leak.
  |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
  |
  |Found:    (lcap: Cap^) ->'s2 () ->'s3 Id[Cap^{lcap}]^'s4
  |Required: (lcap: Cap^) => () =>² Id[Cap^'s1]^'s5
  |
  |where:    =>  refers to a root capability created in value leak when checking argument to parameter op of method withCap
  |          =>² refers to a root capability created in value leak when checking argument to parameter op of method withCap
  |          ^   refers to the root capability caps.any

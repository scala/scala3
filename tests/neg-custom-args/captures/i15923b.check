  |Capability `lcap` outlives its scope: it leaks into outer capture set 's1 which is owned by value leak.
  |The leakage occurred when trying to match the following types:
  |
  |Found:    (x$0: Cap^) -> Id[Cap^{x$0}]
  |Required: (lcap: Cap^) => Id[Cap^'s1]^'s2
  |
  |where:    => refers to a root capability created in value leak when checking argument to parameter op of method withCap
  |          ^  refers to the root capability caps.any

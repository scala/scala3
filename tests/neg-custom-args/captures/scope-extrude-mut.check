-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg-custom-args/captures/scope-extrude-mut.scala:9:8 ------------------------------
9 |    a = a1  // error
  |        ^^
  |        Found:    (a1 : A^)
  |        Required: A^²
  |
  |        Note that capability cap is not included in capture set {cap²}
  |        because cap in method b is not visible from cap² in variable a.
  |
  |        where:    ^ and cap   refer to a fresh root capability classified as Mutable in the type of value a1
  |                  ^² and cap² refer to a fresh root capability classified as Mutable in the type of variable a

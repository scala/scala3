  |        Found:    (a1 : A^)
  |        Required: A^²
  |
  |        Note that capability cap is not included in capture set {cap²}
  |        because cap in method b is not visible from cap² in variable a.

  |        where:    ^    refers to a fresh root capability classified as Mutable in the type of value a1
  |                  ^²   refers to a fresh root capability classified as Mutable in the type of variable a
  |                  cap  is a fresh root capability classified as Mutable in the type of value a1
  |                  cap² is a fresh root capability classified as Mutable in the type of variable a

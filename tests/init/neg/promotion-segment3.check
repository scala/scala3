  |Could not verify that the method argument is transitively initialized (Hot). It was found to be a non-transitively initialized (Warm) object of type (class B) { outer = the original object of type (class A) where initialization checking started }. Only transitively initialized arguments may be passed to methods (except constructors). Calling trace:

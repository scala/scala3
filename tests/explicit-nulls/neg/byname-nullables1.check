   |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |      This argument was typed using flow assumptions about mutable variables
   |      but it is passed to a by-name parameter where such flow assumptions are unsound.
   |      Wrapping the argument in `byName(...)` fixes the problem by disabling the flow assumptions.
   |
   |      `byName` needs to be imported from the `scala.compiletime` package.

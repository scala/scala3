/**
 * CachingDriver is a wrapper class that provides a compilation cache for InteractiveDriver.
 * CachingDriver skips running compilation if
 * - the target URI of `run` is the same as the previous target URI
 * - the content didn't change since the last compilation.
 *
 * This compilation cache enables Metals to skip compilation and re-use
 * the typed tree under the situation like developers
 * sequentially hover on the symbols in the same file without any changes.
 *
 * Note: we decided to cache only if the target URI is the same as in the previous run
 * because of `InteractiveDriver.currentCtx` that should return the context that
 * refers to the last compiled source file.
 * It would be ideal if we could update currentCtx even when we skip the compilation,
 * but we struggled to do that. See the discussion https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/4225#discussion_r941138403
 * To avoid the complexity related to currentCtx,
 * we decided to cache only when the target URI only if the same as the previous run.

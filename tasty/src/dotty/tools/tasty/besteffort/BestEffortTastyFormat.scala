/*************************************************************************************
Best Effort TASTy (.betasty) format extends the TASTy grammar with additional
terminal symbols and productions. Grammar notation is kept from the regular TASTy.
However, the lowercase prefixes describing the semantics (but otherwise not affecting
the grammar) may not always hold.

The following are the added terminal Symbols to the grammar:
  * `ERRORtype` - representing an error from a previous compilation

The following are the added productions to the grammar:

  Standard-Section: "ASTs"
```none
  Type          = ERRORtype
  Path          = ERRORtype
```

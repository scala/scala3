/** Utility class for lazy values whose evaluation depends on a context.
 *  This should be used whenever the evaluation of a lazy expression
 *  depends on some context, but the value can be re-used afterwards
 *  with a different context.
 *
 *  A typical use case is a lazy val in a phase object which exists once per root context where
 *  the expression initializing the lazy val depends only on the root context, but not any changes afterwards.

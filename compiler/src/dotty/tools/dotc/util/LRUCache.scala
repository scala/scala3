 *
 *  Implementation: We keep a ring of eight places, linked
 *  with the `next` data structure. The ring models a priority queue.
 *  `last` points to the last element of the queue, and
 *  `next(last)` to the first one. Lookups compare keys
 *  sequentially from first to last. Elements with successful lookup
 *  get promoted to be first in the queue. Elements are evicted
 *  at the `last` position.

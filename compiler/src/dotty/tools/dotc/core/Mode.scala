 * What's the difference between a boolean setting and a Mode?
 * A setting is usually valid for the entire compilation run, whereas a mode is context specific.
 * Changing a setting in a context creates a new SettingsState in that context, which is a relatively big object.
 * By comparison, a mode is just an Int.
 * But, Mode bits are a scarce resource, so for low priority situations, just reset the state with a setting.
 * Also, a setting is externally settable, while a mode isn't.

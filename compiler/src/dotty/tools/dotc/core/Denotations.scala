/** Denotations represent the meaning of symbols and named types.
 *  The following diagram shows how the principal types of denotations
 *  and their denoting entities relate to each other. Lines ending in
 *  a down-arrow `v` are member methods. The two methods shown in the diagram are
 *  "symbol" and "deref". Both methods are parameterized by the current context,
 *  and are effectively indexed by current period.
 *
 *  Lines ending in a horizontal line mean subtyping (right is a subtype of left).

 *  Here's a short summary of the classes in this diagram.
 *
 *  NamedType                A type consisting of a prefix type and a name, with fields
 *                              prefix: Type
 *                              name: Name
 *                           It has two subtypes: TermRef and TypeRef
 *  Symbol                   A label for a definition or declaration in one compiler run
 *  ClassSymbol              A symbol representing a class
 *  Denotation               The meaning of a named type or symbol during a period
 *  MultiDenotation          A denotation representing several overloaded members
 *  SingleDenotation         A denotation representing a non-overloaded member or definition, with main fields
 *                              symbol: Symbol
 *                              info: Type
 *  UniqueRefDenotation      A denotation referring to a single definition with some member type
 *  JointRefDenotation       A denotation referring to a member that could resolve to several definitions
 *  SymDenotation            A denotation representing a single definition with its original type, with main fields
 *                              name: Name
 *                              owner: Symbol

 *                              annotations: List[Annotation]
 *  ClassDenotation          A denotation representing a single class definition.

     *     or pick `sym1` as a tie breaker. The picked info and symbol are combined

     *     other one, pick the associated denotation.
     *  5. Otherwise return a multi-denotation consisting of both denotations.

     *  give a strong score advantage, the others a weak one.

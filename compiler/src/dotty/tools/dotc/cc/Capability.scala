   *                  Currently we never create results over PolyTypes. TODO change this?
   * Setup:
   *
   *  In the setup phase, `cap` instances in the result of a dependent function type
   *  or method type such as `(x: T): C^{cap}` are converted to `ResultCap(binder)` instances,

   *  is mapped to a Fresh instance.
   *
   *  If one needs to use a dependent function type yet one still want to map `cap` to
   *  a fresh instance instead an existential root, one can achieve that by the use
   *  of a type alias. For instance, the following type creates an existential for `^`:
   *
   *       (x: A) => (C^{x}, D^)

   *
   *       type F[X] = (x: A) => (C^{x}, X)
   *       F[D^]
   *
   *  The trick is that the argument D^ is mapped to D^{fresh} before the `F` alias
   *  is expanded.

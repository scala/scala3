/** A (possibly boxed) capturing type. This is internally represented as an annotated type with a @retains
 *  or @retainsByName annotation, but the extractor will succeed only at phase CheckCaptures.
 *  That way, we can ignore caturing information until phase CheckCaptures since it is
 *  wrapped in a plain annotation.
 *
 *  The same trick does not work for the boxing information. Boxing is context dependent, so
 *  we have to add that information in the Setup step preceding CheckCaptures. Boxes are
 *  added for all type arguments of methods. For type arguments of applied types a different
 *  strategy is used where we box arguments of applied types that are not functions when
 *  accessing the argument.
 *
 *  An alternative strategy would add boxes also to arguments of applied types during setup.
 *  But this would have to be done for all possibly accessibly types from the compiled units
 *  as well as their dependencies. It's difficult to do this in a DenotationTransformer without
 *  accidentally forcing symbol infos. That's why this alternative was not implemented.
 *  If we would go back on this it would make sense to also treat captuyring types different
 *  from annotations and to generate them all during Setup and in DenotationTransformers.

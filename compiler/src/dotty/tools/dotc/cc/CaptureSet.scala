/** A class for capture sets. Capture sets can be constants or variables.
 *  Capture sets support inclusion constraints <:< where <:< is subcapturing.
 *
 *  They also allow
 *   - mapping with functions from elements to capture sets
 *   - filtering with predicates on elements
 *   - intersecting wo capture sets
 *
 *  That is, constraints can be of the forms
 *
 *    cs1 <:< cs2
 *    cs1 = ∪ {f(x) | x ∈ cs2}     where f is a function from capture references to capture sets.
 *    cs1 = ∪ {x | x ∈ cs2, p(x)}  where p is a predicate on capture references
 *    cs1 = cs2 ∩ cs2
 *
 *  We call the resulting constraint system "monadic set constraints".
 *  To support capture propagation across maps, mappings are supported only
 *  if the mapped function is either a bijection or if it is idempotent
 *  on capture references (c.f. doc comment on `map` below).

## Compiler version

If you're not sure which version you're using, run `print scalaVersion` from sbt.
(If you're running scalac manually, use `scalac -version` instead.)

If possible, check if your issue appears in the nightly version of the compiler! For example, in scala-cli, you can use `//> using scala 3.nightly` to grab the latest one.

## Minimized code

<!--
This code should be self contained, compilable (with possible failures) and as small as possible.

Ideally, we should be able to just copy this code to a file and run `scalac` (and maybe `scala`) to reproduce the issue.

If the code has external dependencies, please provide the `scala-cli` directives that describe them.

It's most convenient to also include `using` directives for the Scala version that demonstrates the problem,
any compiler command-line options, as well as dependencies. An example is provided.

It's also fine to paste the transcript of a REPL session. Note that some bugs may be specific to the REPL.
-->

```scala
//> using scala 3.7.0
//> using options -Wall -Werror
//> using dep com.outr::scribe:3.16.1

@main def test = println("hello, world")
```

## Output

```scala
// TODO add output here
```

/** This object provides extension methods that convert between Scala [[scala.concurrent.Future]] and Java
  * [[java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage]]
  *
  * When writing Java code, use the explicit conversion methods defined in
  * [[javaapi.FutureConverters]] instead.
  *
  * Note that the bridge is implemented at the read-only side of asynchronous handles, namely
  * [[scala.concurrent.Future]] (instead of [[scala.concurrent.Promise]]) and [[java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage]] (instead of
  * [[java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture]]). This is intentional, as the semantics of bridging
  * the write-handles would be prone to race conditions; if both ends (`CompletableFuture` and
  * `Promise`) are completed independently at the same time, they may contain different values
  * afterwards. For this reason, `toCompletableFuture` is not supported on the created
  * `CompletionStage`s.

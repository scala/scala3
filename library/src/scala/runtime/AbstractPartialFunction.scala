/** `AbstractPartialFunction` reformulates all operations of its supertrait `PartialFunction`
 *  in terms of `isDefinedAt` and `applyOrElse`.
 *
 *  This allows more efficient implementations in many cases:
 *  - optimized `orElse` method supports chained `orElse` in linear time,
 *    and with no slow-down if the `orElse` part is not needed.
 *  - optimized `lift` method helps to avoid double evaluation of pattern matchers & guards
 *    of partial function literals.
 *
 *  This trait is used as a basis for implementation of all partial function literals.

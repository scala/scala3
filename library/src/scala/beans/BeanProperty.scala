/** When attached to a field, this annotation adds a setter and a getter
 *  method following the Java Bean convention. For example:
 *  ```
 *    @BeanProperty
 *    var status = ""
 *  ```
 *  adds the following methods to the class:
 *  ```
 *    def setStatus(s: String): Unit = { this.status = s }
 *    def getStatus(): String = this.status
 *  ```
 *  For fields of type `Boolean`, if you need a getter named `isStatus`,
 *  use the `scala.beans.BooleanBeanProperty` annotation instead.
 *
 *  In Scala 2, the added methods are visible from both Scala and Java.
 *
 *  In Scala 3, that has changed. The added methods are only visible from
 *  Java (including via Java reflection).

/**
 * Base trait for classes that represent capabilities in the
 * [object-capability model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model).
 *
 * A capability is a value representing a permission, access right, resource or effect.
 * Capabilities are typically passed to code as parameters; they should not be global objects.
 * Often, they come with access restrictions such as scoped lifetimes or limited sharing.
 *
 * An example is the [[scala.util.boundary.Label Label]] class in [[scala.util.boundary]].
 * It represents a capability in the sense that it gives permission to [[scala.util.boundary.break break]]
 * to the enclosing boundary represented by the `Label`. It has a scoped lifetime, since breaking to
 * a `Label` after the associated `boundary` was exited gives a runtime exception.
 *
 * [[Capability]] has a formal meaning when
 * [[scala.language.experimental.captureChecking Capture Checking]]
 * is turned on.
 * But even without capture checking, extending this trait can be useful for documenting the intended purpose
 * of a class.

/** A trait for mutable maps with multiple values assigned to a key.
  *
  *  This class is typically used as a mixin. It turns maps which map `K`
  *  to `Set[V]` objects into multimaps that map `K` to `V` objects.
  *
  *  @example {{{
  *  // first import all necessary types from package `collection.mutable`
  *  import collection.mutable.{ HashMap, MultiMap, Set }
  *
  *  // to create a `MultiMap` the easiest way is to mixin it into a normal
  *  // `Map` instance
  *  val mm = new HashMap[Int, Set[String]] with MultiMap[Int, String]
  *
  *  // to add key-value pairs to a multimap it is important to use
  *  // the method `addBinding` because standard methods like `+` will
  *  // overwrite the complete key-value pair instead of adding the
  *  // value to the existing key
  *  mm.addBinding(1, "a")
  *  mm.addBinding(2, "b")
  *  mm.addBinding(1, "c")
  *
  *  // mm now contains `Map(2 -> Set(b), 1 -> Set(c, a))`
  *
  *  // to check if the multimap contains a value there is method
  *  // `entryExists`, which allows to traverse the including set
  *  mm.entryExists(1, _ == "a") == true
  *  mm.entryExists(1, _ == "b") == false
  *  mm.entryExists(2, _ == "b") == true
  *
  *  // to remove a previous added value there is the method `removeBinding`
  *  mm.removeBinding(1, "a")
  *  mm.entryExists(1, _ == "a") == false
  *  }}}

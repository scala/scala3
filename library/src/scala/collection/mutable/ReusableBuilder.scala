/** `ReusableBuilder` is a marker trait that indicates that a `Builder`
  *  can be reused to build more than one instance of a collection.  In
  *  particular, calling `result()` followed by `clear()` will produce a
  *  collection and reset the builder to begin building a new collection
  *  of the same type.
  *
  *  In general no method other than `clear()` may be called after `result()`.
  *  It is up to subclasses to implement and to document other allowed sequences
  *  of operations (e.g. calling other methods after `result()` in order to obtain
  *  different snapshots of a collection under construction).
  *
  *  @tparam  Elem  the type of elements that get added to the builder.
  *  @tparam  To    the type of collection that it produced.
  *
  *  @define multipleResults
  *
  *     This Builder can be reused after calling `result()` without an
  *     intermediate call to `clear()` in order to build multiple related results.

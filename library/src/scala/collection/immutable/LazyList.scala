/**  This class implements an immutable linked list. We call it "lazy"
  *  because it computes its elements only when they are needed.
  *
  *  Elements are memoized; that is, the value of each element is computed at most once.
  *
  *  Elements are computed in order and are never skipped.
  *  As a consequence, accessing the tail causes the head to be computed first.
  *
  *  How lazy is a `LazyList`? When you have a value of type `LazyList`, you
  *  don't know yet whether the list is empty.
  *  We say that it is lazy in its head.
  *  If you have tested that it is non-empty,
  *  then you also know that the head has been computed.
  *
  *  It is also lazy in its tail, which is also a `LazyList`.
  *  You don't know whether the tail is empty until it is "forced", which is to say,
  *  until an element of the tail is computed.
  *
  *  These important properties of `LazyList` depend on its construction using `#::` (or `#:::`).
  *  That operator is analogous to the "cons" of a strict `List`, `::`.
  *  It is "right-associative", so that the collection goes on the "right",
  *  and the element on the left of the operator is prepended to the collection.
  *  However, unlike the cons of a strict `List`, `#::` is lazy in its parameter,
  *  which is the element prepended to the left, and also lazy in its right-hand side,
  *  which is the `LazyList` being prepended to.
  *  (That is accomplished by implicitly wrapping the `LazyList`, as shown in the Scaladoc.)
  *
  *  Other combinators from the collections API do not preserve this laziness.
  *  In particular, `++`, or `concat`, is "eager" or "strict" in its parameter
  *  and should not be used to compose `LazyList`s.
  *
  *  A `LazyList` may be infinite. For example, `LazyList.from(0)` contains
  *  all of the natural numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, ... For infinite sequences,
  *  some methods (such as `count`, `sum`, `max` or `min`) will not terminate.
  *
  *  Here is an example showing the Fibonacci sequence,
  *  which may be evaluated to an arbitrary number of elements:
  *
  *  {{{
  *  import scala.math.BigInt
  *  val fibs: LazyList[BigInt] =
  *    BigInt(0) #:: BigInt(1) #:: fibs.zip(fibs.tail).map(n => n._1 + n._2)
  *  println {
  *    fibs.take(5).mkString(", ")
  *  }
  *  // prints: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
  *  }}}
  *
  *  To illustrate, let's add some output to the definition `fibs`, so we
  *  see what's going on.
  *
  *  {{{
  *  import scala.math.BigInt
  *  import scala.util.chaining._
  *  val fibs: LazyList[BigInt] =
  *    BigInt(0) #:: BigInt(1) #::
  *      fibs.zip(fibs.tail).map(n => (n._1 + n._2)
  *      .tap(sum => println(s"Adding ${n._1} and ${n._2} => $sum")))
  *  fibs.take(5).foreach(println)
  *  fibs.take(6).foreach(println)
  *
  *  // prints
  *  //
  *  // 0
  *  // 1
  *  // Adding 0 and 1 => 1
  *  // 1
  *  // Adding 1 and 1 => 2
  *  // 2
  *  // Adding 1 and 2 => 3
  *  // 3
  *
  *  // And then prints
  *  //
  *  // 0
  *  // 1
  *  // 1
  *  // 2
  *  // 3
  *  // Adding 2 and 3 => 5
  *  // 5
  *  }}}
  *
  *  Note that the definition of `fibs` uses `val` not `def`.
  *  Memoization of the `LazyList` requires us to retain a reference to the computed values.
  *
  *  `LazyList` is considered an immutable data structure, even though its elements are computed on demand.
  *  Once the values are memoized they do not change.
  *  Moreover, the `LazyList` itself is defined once and references to it are interchangeable.
  *  Values that have yet to be memoized still "exist"; they simply haven't been computed yet.
  *
  *  Memoization can be a source of memory leaks and must be used with caution.
  *  It avoids recomputing elements of the list, but if a reference to the head
  *  is retained unintentionally, then all elements will be retained.
  *
  *  The caveat that all elements are computed in order means
  *  that some operations, such as [[drop]], [[dropWhile]], [[flatMap]] or [[collect]],
  *  may process a large number of intermediate elements before returning.
  *
  *  Here's an example that illustrates these behaviors.
  *  Let's begin with an iteration of the natural numbers.
  *
  *  {{{
  *  // We'll start with a silly iteration
  *  def loop(s: String, i: Int, iter: Iterator[Int]): Unit = {
  *    // Stop after 200,000
  *    if (i < 200001) {
  *      if (i % 50000 == 0) println(s + i)
  *      loop(s, iter.next(), iter)
  *    }
  *  }
  *
  *  // Our first LazyList definition will be a val definition
  *  val lazylist1: LazyList[Int] = {
  *    def loop(v: Int): LazyList[Int] = v #:: loop(v + 1)
  *    loop(0)
  *  }
  *
  *  // Because lazylist1 is a val, everything that the iterator produces is held
  *  // by virtue of the fact that the head of the LazyList is held in lazylist1
  *  val it1 = lazylist1.iterator
  *  loop("Iterator1: ", it1.next(), it1)
  *
  *  // We can redefine this LazyList such that we retain only a reference to its Iterator.
  *  // That allows the LazyList to be garbage collected.
  *  // Using `def` to produce the LazyList in a method ensures
  *  // that no val is holding onto the head, as with lazylist1.
  *  def lazylist2: LazyList[Int] = {
  *    def loop(v: Int): LazyList[Int] = v #:: loop(v + 1)
  *    loop(0)
  *  }
  *  val it2 = lazylist2.iterator
  *  loop("Iterator2: ", it2.next(), it2)
  *
  *  // And, of course, we don't actually need a LazyList at all for such a simple
  *  // problem.  There's no reason to use a LazyList if you don't actually need
  *  // one.
  *  val it3 = new Iterator[Int] {
  *    var i = -1
  *    def hasNext = true
  *    def next(): Int = { i += 1; i }
  *  }
  *  loop("Iterator3: ", it3.next(), it3)
  *  }}}
  *
  *  In the `fibs` example earlier, the fact that `tail` works at all is of interest.
  *  `fibs` has an initial `(0, 1, LazyList(...))`, so `tail` is deterministic.
  *  If we defined `fibs` such that only `0` were concretely known, then the act
  *  of determining `tail` would require the evaluation of `tail`, so the
  *  computation would be unable to progress, as in this code:
  *  {{{
  *  // The first time we try to access the tail we're going to need more
  *  // information which will require us to recurse, which will require us to
  *  // recurse, which...
  *  lazy val sov: LazyList[Vector[Int]] = Vector(0) #:: sov.zip(sov.tail).map { n => n._1 ++ n._2 }
  *  }}}
  *
  *  The definition of `fibs` above creates a larger number of objects than
  *  necessary depending on how you might want to implement it.  The following
  *  implementation provides a more "cost effective" implementation due to the
  *  fact that it has a more direct route to the numbers themselves:
  *
  *  {{{
  *  lazy val fib: LazyList[Int] = {
  *    def loop(h: Int, n: Int): LazyList[Int] = h #:: loop(n, h + n)
  *    loop(1, 1)
  *  }
  *  }}}
  *
  *  The head, the tail and whether the list is empty is initially unknown.
  *  Once any of those are evaluated, they are all known, though if the tail is
  *  built with `#::` or `#:::`, its content still isn't evaluated. Instead, evaluating
  *  the tail's content is deferred until the tail's empty status, head or tail is
  *  evaluated.
  *
  *  Delaying the evaluation of whether a LazyList is empty until it's needed
  *  allows LazyList to not eagerly evaluate any elements on a call to `filter`.
  *
  *  Only when it's further evaluated (which may be never!) do any of the elements get forced.
  *
  *  For example:
  *
  *  {{{
  *  def tailWithSideEffect: LazyList[Nothing] = {
  *    println("getting empty LazyList")
  *    LazyList.empty
  *  }
  *
  *  val emptyTail = tailWithSideEffect // prints "getting empty LazyList"
  *
  *  val suspended = 1 #:: tailWithSideEffect // doesn't print anything
  *  val tail = suspended.tail // although the tail is evaluated, *still* nothing is yet printed
  *  val filtered = tail.filter(_ => false) // still nothing is printed
  *  filtered.isEmpty // prints "getting empty LazyList"
  *  }}}
  *
  *  ----
  *
  *  You may sometimes encounter an exception like the following:
  *
  *  {{{
  *  java.lang.RuntimeException: "LazyList evaluation depends on its own result (self-reference); see docs for more info
  *  }}}
  *
  *  This exception occurs when a `LazyList` is attempting to derive its next element
  *  from itself, and is attempting to read the element currently being evaluated.
  *  As a trivial example:
  *
  *  {{{
  *  lazy val a: LazyList[Int] = 1 #:: 2 #:: a.filter(_ > 2)
  *  }}}
  *
  *  When attempting to evaluate the third element of `a`, it will skip the first two
  *  elements and read the third, but that element is already being evaluated. This is
  *  often caused by a subtle logic error; in this case, using `>=` in the `filter`
  *  would fix the error.
  *
  *  @tparam A    the type of the elements contained in this lazy list.
  *
  *  @see [[https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/concrete-immutable-collection-classes.html#lazylists "Scala's Collection Library overview"]]
  *  section on `LazyLists` for a summary.

  *                            intermediate resulting lazy lists may overflow the stack when
  *                            the final result is forced.
  *  @define preservesLaziness This method preserves laziness; elements are only evaluated
  *                            individually as needed.

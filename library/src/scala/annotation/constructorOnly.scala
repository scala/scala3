/** An annotation that goes on parameters of classes or traits. It asserts
 *  that the parameter is used only for initialization and is not kept in
 *  the class as a field. Violations of this assertion are flagged as
 *  compile errors. The annotation is particularly useful for implicit
 *  parameters since for these a textual scan is not sufficient to know
 *  where they are used.
 *  Note: the annotation is copied from constructor parameters to corresponding
 *  class fields. But it is checked that the field is eliminated before code
 *  is generated.

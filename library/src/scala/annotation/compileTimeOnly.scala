/**
 * An annotation that designates that an annottee should not be referred to after
 * type checking (which includes macro expansion).
 *
 * Examples of potential use:
 *   1) The annottee can only appear in the arguments of some other macro
 *      that will eliminate it from the AST during expansion.
 *   2) The annottee is a macro and should have been expanded away,
 *      so if hasn't, something wrong has happened.
 *      (Comes in handy to provide better support for new macro flavors,
 *      e.g. macro annotations, that can't be expanded by the vanilla compiler).
 *
 * @param  message the error message to print during compilation if a reference remains
 *                 after type checking

/**
 * A base class for annotations.
 *
 * Annotations extending this class directly are not preserved in the classfile. To enable storing
 * annotations in the classfile's Scala signature and make it available to Scala reflection and
 * other tools, the annotation needs to inherit from [[scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation]].
 *
 * Annotation classes defined in Scala are not stored in classfiles in a Java-compatible manner
 * and therefore not visible in Java reflection. In order to achieve this, the annotation has to
 * be written in Java.

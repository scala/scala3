 *
 *  Each of these features has to be explicitly imported into the current scope to become available:
 *  {{{
 *     import language.postfixOps // or language._
 *     List(1, 2, 3) reverse
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The language features are:
 *   - [[dynamics            `dynamics`]]            enables defining calls rewriting using the [[scala.Dynamic `Dynamic`]] trait
 *   - [[existentials        `existentials`]]        enables writing existential types
 *   - [[higherKinds         `higherKinds`]]         enables writing higher-kinded types
 *   - [[implicitConversions `implicitConversions`]] enables defining implicit methods and members
 *   - [[postfixOps          `postfixOps`]]          enables postfix operators (not recommended)
 *   - [[reflectiveCalls     `reflectiveCalls`]]     enables using structural types
 *   - [[experimental        `experimental`]]        contains newer features that have not yet been tested in production

   *  `Parents { Decls }` where `Decls` contains declarations of new members that do

   *  An implicit conversion is an implicit value of unary function type `A => B`,
   *  or an implicit method that has in its first parameter section a single,
   *  non-implicit parameter. Examples:
   *

   *     implicit val numerals: List[String] = List("zero", "one", "two", "three")
   *     implicit val strlen: String => Int = _.length
   *     implicit def listToInt[T](xs: List[T])(implicit f: T => Int): Int = xs.map(f).sum

   *  This language feature warns only for implicit conversions introduced by methods.
   *
   *  Other values, including functions or data types which extend `Function1`,
   *  such as `Map`, `Set`, and `List`, do not warn.
   *
   *  Implicit class definitions, which introduce a conversion to the wrapping class,
   *  also do not warn.
   *
   *  '''Why keep the feature?''' Implicit conversions are central to many aspects
   *  of Scala’s core libraries.
   *
   *  '''Why control it?''' Implicit conversions are known to cause many pitfalls
   *  if over-used. And there is a tendency to over-use them because they look
   *  very powerful and their effects seem to be easy to understand. Also, in
   *  most situations using implicit parameters leads to a better design than

   *  '''Why keep the feature?''' Higher-kinded types enable the definition of very general
   *  abstractions such as functor, monad, or arrow. A significant set of advanced
   *  libraries relies on them. Higher-kinded types are also at the core of the
   *  scala-virtualized effort to produce high-performance parallel DSLs through staging.
   *
   *  '''Why control it?''' Higher kinded types in Scala lead to a Turing-complete
   *  type system, where compiler termination is no longer guaranteed. They tend
   *  to be useful mostly for type-level computation and for highly generic design
   *  patterns. The level of abstraction implied by these design patterns is often
   *  a barrier to understanding for newcomers to a Scala codebase. Some syntactic
   *  aspects of higher-kinded types are hard to understand for the uninitiated and
   *  type inference is less effective for them than for normal types. Because we are
   *  not completely happy with them yet, it is possible that some aspects of
   *  higher-kinded types will change in future versions of Scala. So an explicit
   *  enabling also serves as a warning that code involving higher-kinded types
   *  might have to be slightly revised in the future.

   *
   *  Existential types with wildcard type syntax such as `List[?]`,

   *  application code very brittle, with a tendency to produce type errors with
   *  obscure error messages. Therefore, going overboard with existential types
